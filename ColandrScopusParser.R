# This script reads a CSV file exported by Colandr (https://www.colandrcommunity.com/) 
# and outputs an ASCII text file with search strings using that can be pasted into the 
# Scopus “Advanced” search interface. 

# The script first extracts citations that are flagged as "citation_screening_status" = "included". 
# Next, the titles of all included citations are extracted and formatted as a Scopus 
# search string. Due to a constraint in Scopus that limits the length of a search string 
# the script subsets the full search string into sets with a user-defined number of titles. 
# For example, if you had 95 citations and wanted ten titles in a single search string you 
# would set “numPapers” to ten. The output ASCII text file would have nine search strings 
# with 10 titles and a tenth with five titles. 
#
# Set the variables below in the "SET VARIABLES HERE" section of the script.
