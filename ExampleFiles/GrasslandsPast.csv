They are found disjunctly in eastern Asia and North America, and this distribution has been deeply affected by the region's complex geological and climatic history. We calculate a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny and use it to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the Panorpodidae, in order to explore the family's phylogenetic origin and the biogeographical process that resulted in the present disjunct distribution. Location: Eastern Asia and North America. Methods: Sequence data from mitochondrial (COI and COII) and nuclear DNA (28S and EF-1α) were assembled from eight ingroup species. A phylogeny was reconstructed using maximum-likelihood analysis and Bayesian inference, and divergence times were estimated using fossil-calibrated Bayesian analysis. Ancestral areas were reconstructed with rasp 3.02, implementing dispersal–vicariance analysis, dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis and Bayesian binary MCMC. Results: The initial diversification of Panorpodidae occurred during the Ypresian (c. 53.9 Ma). A wide ancestral distribution in eastern Asia and western North America was inferred from the biogeographical analyses. The original range of Panorpodes across eastern Asia and western North America was fragmented by intercontinental vicariance. The genus Brachypanorpa was initially restricted to western North America and subsequently dispersed into eastern regions of North America. Main conclusions: Two alternative biogeographical patterns were recovered. Either Panorpodidae was restricted to western North America in the Eocene and subsequently dispersed into eastern Asia or – more reasonably – it was widely distributed in western North America, eastern Asia and Europe during the Eocene. Our biogeographical reconstructions corroborate the significant role of vicariance in shaping the current eastern Asian and North American disjunction in Panorpodes. The geographical separation of western and eastern North American Brachypanorpa species is likely to have resulted from the uplift of the Rocky Mountains and the emergence of grassland biomes in central North America. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Hu, G.-L.; Hua, B.-Z.","","43",2016,"Brachypanorpa; Panorpodes; disjunct distribution; molecular dating; phylogeny; vicariance","","","","","","","","",""

These specimens were recovered from remnant native prairies in the central tallgrass ecoregion of North America, and not from surrounding agroecosystems. Historical records indicate that M. curvatum is a cosmopolitan species feeding on a wide range of agronomic and native plants. DNA barcoding indicates North American grasslands contain at least 10 phylogenetically distinct lineages of Mesocriconema that resemble, but are not, M. curvatum. Analysis of the two most common lineages reveals two distinctly different population structures. The variation in population structure suggests unique evolutionary histories associated with their diversification. These two major lineages share a sympatric distribution and their slight morphological differences contrast with a high level of genetic separation. Based on their genetic divergence, fixed diagnostic nucleotides, population structure, species delimitation metrics, and a sympatric distribution, we believe that one of these distinct lineages warrants formal nomenclatural recognition.

This response appears to be rooted in the perception that grassland birds invaded the East Coast from western grasslands after European settlers cleared the forest. Detailed historical accounts and analysis of pollen deposits, however, show that open grasslands existed on the East Coast of North America at the time of European settlement. Extensive grasslands resulted from burning and agricultural clearing by Native Americans. Natural disturbances, such as wildfire and beaver (Castor canadensis) activity, produced grasslands even before Native Americans cleared the forest. The presence of specialized grassland birds in Pleistocene deposits and in the earliest ornithological collections from eastern North America, and the existence of distinctive eastern populations of the Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii), and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), indicate that grassland birds are an ancient component of biological diversity on the heavily forested East Coast of North America.","Askins, R.A.","","",1999,"Beaver; Bird populations; Disturbance; Eastern grasslands; Grassland birds","","","","","","","","",""

This radiation has been linked to climatic and vegetation changes that occurred in North America during this time. However, the relationship between climate change and speciation has not previously been studied quantitatively using phylogenetic biogeography. Distribution and age-range data were collected for all North American species within eighteen equine genera through a literature review and use of the Paleobiology Database. Fitch parsimony analysis of the taxon-area cladogram indicate that speciation by dispersal (Allopatry model II) was more common in the evolution of the clade than speciation by vicariance (Allopatry model I). Distribution data were analyzed using the Lieberman-modified Brooks Parsimony Analysis (LBPA) to determine patterns of vicariance and geodispersal, using four constrained biogeographic regions within North America in the analysis: the Great Plains, the Southwest, the Gulf Coast and the Southeast. Resulting general area cladograms are congruent with geological events, such as uplift of the Rocky Mountains, and climatic conditions, such as the change from a warm and moist to cool and arid climate during the Miocene. Well supported vicariance and geodispersal trees derived from the LBPA analysis are largely congruent with each other, indicating that cyclical events, in particular, climate change during the Miocene influenced the radiation of the clade. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Native to Eurasia, its unintentional introduction into North America now threatens the native flora and is responsible for enormous agricultural losses. The goals of this study are to: (1) reconstruct the evolutionary history of C. arvense and estimate how often it may have colonized North America, (2) compare the genetic diversity between European and North American populations to detect signs of demographic bottlenecks and/or patterns of population admixture, and (3) conduct bioclimatic comparisons to infer eventual niche shifts following this species' introduction into North America. Location Europe and North America. Methods A total of 1522 individuals from 58 populations were investigated with six microsatellite markers. Estimates of heterozygosity (H E) and allelic richness (R S) were quantified for each population, and population structure was inferred via analyses of molecular variance (AMOVAs), principal components analyses (PCAs), Mantel tests and Bayesian clustering analyses. Climatic niche spaces were based on 19 bioclimatic variables extracted from approximately 32,000 locations covering the entire range, and compared using PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis. Results Although there is evidence of multiple introductions from divergent European lineages, North American populations of C. arvense exhibited significantly lower levels of genetic diversity than their putative ancestors. Bioclimatic comparisons pointed to a high degree of niche conservatism during invasion, but indicated that genotypes from the former USSR and Central European mountain chains were probably best adapted to invade North America upon entry into the continent. Main conclusions Genetic and historical data suggest that C. arvense first entered North America from Western Europe with the first European settlers, and was later introduced from Eastern Europe into the prairie states during the agricultural boom. The species went through a significant bottleneck following its introduction into the New World, but the level of genetic diversity remained high owing to admixture between genetically differentiated lineages and to a highly efficient outcrossing breeding system. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Anderson, J.V.; Foley, M.E.; Guggisberg, A.; Horvath, D.P.; Rieseberg, L.H.; Sforza, R.; Welk, E.","","39",2012,"Adaptation; Asteraceae; Bioclimatic niche modelling; Cirsium arvense; Colonization history; Compositae; Genetic bottleneck; Invasive plant; Multiple introductions; Phylogeography","","","","","","","","",""

The Quaternary, the most recent period of exchange, is characterized by large, geologically rapid climate fluctuations and sea-level changes that alternately expose and inundate the land-bridge region. Insights into how Quaternary land-bridge geography has controlled species exchange and assembly of the North American flora comes from focusing on a restricted community with narrow ecological tolerances: species that are today restricted to isolated steppe habitats (dry grasslands) in the Subarctic. We evaluated (i) potential controls over current spatial distributions of steppe plants and their pollinators in Alaska and Yukon and (ii) their ecological distributions in relation to potential biogeographic histories. Taxa present in North America that are disjunct from Asia tended to have larger altitudinal ranges (tolerating colder temperatures) than taxa disjunct from farther south in North America, which were largely restricted to the warmest, lowest-elevation sites. Ecological findings support the following biogeographic scenarios. Migration from Asia via the land-bridge occurred during Quaternary glacial periods when conditions were colder and drier than today. While a corridor for migration of cold-tolerant species of cold steppe and tundra, the land bridge acted as a filter that excluded warmth-demanding species. Migration from North America occurred under warm, dry interglacial conditions; thermophilous North American disjuncts taking this route may have long histories in Beringia, or they may have migrated recently during the relatively warm and dry early Holocene, when forest cover was incomplete. © 2018 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Armbruster, W.S.; Edwards, M.E.; Lloyd, A.","","56",2018,"Alaska; Beringia; Quaternary environments; altitudinal range; relict distributions; steppe; subarctic; thermal range","","","","","","","","",""

Molecular markers can reveal invasion histories and the effects of introductions on amounts and structuring of genetic variation. We used five polymorphic microsatellite loci to elucidate genetic diversity and population structure between native range and introduced range populations of a prominent North American rangeland weed, Centaurea diffusa (Asteraceae). We found that the total number of alleles and the number of private alleles was slightly higher in the native Eurasian range, and that allelic richness did not differ between the ranges, indicating overall levels of diversity were similar in Eurasia and North America. It therefore seems unlikely that this invasion has been affected by genetic bottlenecks or founder effects. Indeed, results of assignment tests suggest that multiple introductions have contributed to North America's C. diffusa invasion. Additionally, assignment tests show that both Eurasian and North American sites had a strong pattern of mixed genetic ancestry. This mixed assignment corresponded to a lack of geographic population structure among Eurasian samples. The lack of population structure in the native range conflicts with general expectations and findings to date for invasion genetics, and cautions that even species' native ranges may show signs of recent ecological upheaval. Despite the mixed assignments, North American samples showed strong population structure, suggesting that the invasion has been characterized by long-range dispersal of genetically distinct propagules across the introduced range. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Hufbauer, R.A.; Marrs, R.A.; Sforza, R.","","10",2008,"Centaurea diffusa; Centaurea maculosa; Centaurea stoebe; Diffuse knapweed; Genetic diversity; Invasive species; Microsatellites; Population genetic structure","","","","","","","","",""

Their decline was temporally and spatially heterogeneous, and the gomphotheres ultimately became extinct during the late Pleistocene; however, the genus Cuvieronius is rarely represented in late Pleistocene assemblages in North America. Two alternative hypotheses have been invoked to explain this phenomenon: (1) competitive exclusion by sympatric mammoths and mastodons or (2) ecologic displacement due to an environmental transition from closed forests to open grasslands. To test whether competition for resources contributed to the demise of North American Cuvieronius, we present herein a large collection of stable isotope and dental microwear data from populations occupying their Pleistocene refugium in the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Results suggest that Cuvieronius consumed a wide range of resources with variable textural and photosynthetic properties and was not specialized on either grasses or browse. Further, we document evidence for the consumption of similar foods between contemporaneous gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. The generalist feeding strategy of the gomphotheres likely facilitated their high Miocene abundance and diversity. However, this jack of all trades and master of none feeding strategy may have proved challenging following the arrival of mammoths and likely contributed to the extirpation of Cuvieronius in North America. © The Paleontological Society.

In this region of the modern prairie-forest border, the δ13C signature of soil organic matter is a reliable indicator of past climatic change because δ13C values are controlled primarily by the relative abundance of C3 and C4 plants, which is tied to the environmental setting. Between ca. 13,200 and 11,900 yr ago, the abundance of C4 grasses increased by upwards of 50% of the total biomass, indicating expansion of grassland most likely driven by increased aridity during this period.

During most of the Tertiary, the primary source area of these new taxa was Eurasia with dispersal across some version of the Bering Land Bridge. In the late Pliocene (Blancan) ca. 2.5 mya, the creation of the Panamanian Land Bridge permitted the northward dispersal of species of South American origin including ground sloths. One of these sloths was ""Glossotherium"" chapadmalense, which in turn gave rise to the Pleistocene species Paramylodon harlani. Mammoths first appear in North America at the beginning of the Irvingtonian ca. 1.9 mya. Despite originating on two different continents, the two species are often found together in North American Pleistocene faunas and shared a common habitat. Both of these lineages are commonly interpreted as grazers, indicative of open grassland habitat, and both of these exotic species shared this habitat with North American endemic species such as horses, also interpreted as grazers. Despite their association in North American faunas, mammoths did not disperse into South America and mylodont sloths were unable to disperse into Eurasia. This suggests there were some aspects of their ecology they did not have in common and there existed a limited zone of conditions that permitted them to share common habitat. There is no evidence that the appearance of either species in North America resulted in the extinction of any native species. The question is how these different species, immigrants and endemics, were able to avoid competition, coexist, and become integrated into a single fauna, thus enriching the overall North American Pleistocene fauna.","McDonald, H.G.; Pelikan, S.","","142-143",2006,"","","","","","","","","",""

Paleontologically, these morphs are conventionally recognized as species. In Pleistocene North America alone, several mammoth species have been recognized, inhabiting environments as different as cold tundra-steppe in the north and the arid grasslands or temperate savanna-parklands of the south. Yet mammoth phylogeographic studies have overwhelmingly focused on permafrost-preserved remains of only one of these species, Mammuthus primigenius (woolly mammoth). Here we challenge this bias by performing a geographically and taxonomically wide survey of mammoth genetic diversity across North America. Using a targeted enrichment technique, we sequenced 67 complete mitochondrial genomes including non-primigenius specimens representing Mammuthus columbi (Columbian mammoth), Mammuthus jeffersonii (Jeffersonian mammoth), and Mammuthus exilis (pygmy mammoth), including specimens from contexts not generally associated with good DNA preservation. While we uncovered clear phylogeographic structure in mammoth matrilines, their phylogeny as recovered from mitochondrial DNA is not compatible with existing systematic interpretations of their paleontological record. Instead, our results strongly suggest that various nominal mammoth species interbred, perhaps extensively. We hypothesize that at least two distinct stages of interbreeding between conventional paleontological species are likely responsible for this pattern-one between Siberian woolly mammoths and resident American populations that introduced woolly mammoth phenotypes to the continent, and another between ecomorphologically distinct populations of woolly and Columbian mammoths in North America south of the ice. © 2016 Enk, Devault, Widga, Saunders, Szpak, Southon, Rouillard, Shapiro, Golding, Zazula, Froese, Fisher, MacPhee and Poinar.","Brian Golding, G.; Devault, A.; Enk, J.; Fisher, D.C.; Froese, D.; MacPhee, R.D.E.; Poinar, H.; Rouillard, J.-M.; Saunders, J.; Shapiro, B.; Southon, J.; Szpak, P.; Widga, C.; Zazula, G.","","4",2016,"Ancient DNA; Mammoths; North America; Phylogenetics; Phylogeography; Pleistocene; Targeted enrichment","","","","","","","","",""

Location: Data was collected from the southern North American grasslands of Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. Methods: High resolution, annual pollen-influx data gathered in Tauber pollen traps were analyzed using cluster analysis to summarize the pollen signature from each trap locality and to catagorize the samples into discrete grassland groups. Results: Based on the results of the cluster analysis, each grassland produces a distinctive pollen signature that can be used to distinguish between grassland types. In addition, pollen influx is shown to be closely correlated with annual precipitation. Main conclusions: The ability to distinguish between grassland types and to relate annual influx to annual precipitation has important implications for understanding the evolution of grasslands during the Holocene, for palaeoclimatic studies, and for monitoring ecosystem changes in the present-day grasslands.","Hoyt, C.A.","","27",2000,"Chihuahuan Desert; North American grasslands; Pollen; Southern Great Plains","","","","","","","","",""

The greatest extensions of non-arctic tidal marshes are found along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America, but local concentrations can be found in Great Britain, northern Europe, northern Japan, northern China, and northern Korea, Argentina-Uruguay- Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand. We tallied the number of terrestrial vertebrate species that regularly occupy tidal marshes in each of these regions, as well as species or subspecies that are largely restricted to tidal marshes. In each of the major coastal areas we found 8-21 species of breeding birds and 13-25 species of terrestrial mammals. The diversity of tidal-marsh birds and mammals is highly inter-correlated, as is the diversity of species restricted to saltmarshes. These values are, in turn, correlated with tidal-marsh area along a coastline. We estimate approximately seven species of turtles occur in brackish or saltmarshes worldwide, but only one species is endemic and it is found in eastern North America. A large number of frogs and snakes occur opportunistically in tidal marshes, primarily in southeastern United States, particularly Florida. Three endemic snake taxa are restricted to tidal marshes of eastern North America as well. Overall, only in North America were we able to find documentation for multiple taxa of terrestrial vertebrates associated with tidal marshes. These include one species of mammal and two species of birds, one species of snake, and one species of turtle. However, an additional 11 species of birds, seven species of mammals, and at least one snake have morphologically distinct subspecies associated with tidal marshes. Not surprisingly, species not restricted entirely to tidal marshes are shared predominantly with freshwater marshes and to a lesser degree with grasslands. The prevalence of endemic subspecies in North American marshes can either be a real biogeographical phenomenon or be attributable to how finely species are divided into subspecies in different regions. The difference between North America and Eurasia is almost certainly a biological reality. Additional taxonomic and ecological work needs to be undertaken on South American marsh vertebrates to confirm the lack of endemism and specialization there. Assuming that the pattern of greater degree of differentiation in North American tidal-marsh vertebrates is accurate, we propose that the extension and stability of North American marshes and the existence of connected southern refugia along the Gulf Coast during the Pleistocene contributed to the diversification there. The relatively large number of endemics found along the west coast of North America seems anomalous considering the overall low diversity of tidal marsh species and the limited areas of marsh which are mostly concentrated around the San Francisco Bay area.","Greenberg, R.; Maldonado, J.E.","","",2006,"Biogeography; Habitat specialization; Saltmarsh; Wetland vertebrates","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed the control of a key ecosystem process, aboveground net primary production (ANPP), by interannual variation in precipitation amount and pattern via analysis of data sets (15- and 24-year periods) from long-term research programs on each continent. Both sites were dominated by C4 grasses and had similar growing season climates; thus, we expected convergence in precipitation-ANPP relationships. Lack of convergence, however, would support an alternative hypothesis-that differences in evolutionary history and purportedly greater climatic variability in South Africa fundamentally alter the functioning of southern versus northern hemisphere grasslands. Neither mean annual precipitation nor mean ANPP differed between the South African and North American sites (838 vs. 857 mm/year, 423.5 vs. 461.4 g/m2 respectively) and growing season precipitation-ANPP relationships were similar. Despite overall convergence, there were differences between sites in how the seasonal timing of precipitation affected ANPP. In particular, interannual variability in precipitation that fell during the first half of the growing season strongly affected annual ANPP in South Africa (P &lt; 0.01), but was not related to ANPP in North America (P = 0.098). Both sites were affected similarly by late season precipitation. Divergence in the seasonal course of available soil moisture (chronically low in the winter and early spring in the South African site vs. high in the North American site) is proposed as a key contingent factor explaining differential sensitivity in ANPP to early season precipitation in these two grasslands. These long-term data sets provided no support for greater rainfall, temperature or ANPP variability in the South African versus the North American site. However, greater sensitivity of ANPP to early season precipitation in the South African grassland suggests that future patterns of productivity may be more responsive to seasonal changes in climate compared with the North American site. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Burns, C.E.; Fynn, R.W.S.; Kirkman, K.P.; Knapp, A.K.; Morris, C.D.; Smith, M.D.","","149",2006,"Climate; Evolutionary history; Net primary production; Precipitation; Soil moisture","","","","","","","","",""

The familiar story of the Neogene evolution of this biome is of the replacement of ungulates (hoofed mammals) having a primarily browsing diet by the more derived grazing ungulates. However, new data show a more complicated pattern of faunal succession. There was a maximum taxonomic diversity of ungulates at 16-14 Ma, including a large number of grazers, and the subsequent decline in overall diversity was largely due to the decline of the browsers, with little corresponding increase in the grazers. Additionally the mid Miocene faunas (∼ 18-12 Ma) contained a much greater number of browsers than any comparable present-day habitat. We discuss possible explanations for these non-analogous grassland faunas, including the possibility that the primary productivity of the vegetation was greater in the early to middle Miocene than it is today. One possible explanation for increased primary productivity is higher Miocene levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide than in the present day.

Broad-leaved evergreen forests in both hemispheres were equatorward of 35o, and multistratal forests equatorward of 20o. In the southern hemisphere, areas between 35-50o were occupied by a mixed forest of conifers and broad-leaved evergreens.

The modern data presented are the typical (average) assemblages for 34 modern localities taken throughout the Great Plains. Modern assemblage variability across the region is substantial. This variability shows a coherent geographical pattern consistent with modern grassland composition. These modern phytolith assemblages are calibrated in terms of modern climate data: specifically July mean temperature. Seven fossil assemblages from three late Pleistocene localities in the central Great Plains are presented. Two alternative phytolith-temperature regression models are applied to these fossil assemblages to estimate paleo-temperature. Resulting estimates are consistent with other efforts to calculate late Pleistocene temperature departures in the region (ca. -8.0 to -7.0°C). The fossil data also show rapid change in grassland composition and climate during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.

We investigated the spatio-temporal climatic niche dynamics of the spotted knapweed in North America along two putative eastern and western invasion routes. We then considered the patterns observed in the light of historical, ecological and evolutionary factors. Location: Europe and North America. Methods: The niche characteristics of the east and west invasive populations of spotted knapweed in North America were determined from documented occurrences over 120 consecutive years (1890-2010). For this investigation, the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of values along temperature and precipitation gradients, as given by the two first axes of a principal components analysis (PCA), were calculated. We additionally measured the climatic dissimilarity between invaded sites and the native niche using a multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) analysis. Results: Along both invasion routes, the species established in regions with climatic conditions that were similar to those in the native niche. An initial spread in ruderal habitats always preceded spread in (semi-)natural habitats. In the east, the niche gradually increased over time until it reached limits similar to the native niche. Conversely, in the west the niche abruptly expanded after an extended time lag into climates not occupied in the native range; only the native cold niche limit was conserved. Main conclusions: Our study reveals that different niche dynamics have taken place during the eastern and western invasions. This pattern indicates different combinations of historical, ecological and evolutionary factors in the two ranges. We hypothesize that the lack of a well-developed transportation network in the west at the time of the introduction of spotted knapweed confined the species to a geographically and climatically isolated region. The invasion of dry rangelands may have been favoured during the agricultural transition in the 1930s by release from natural enemies, local adaptation and less competitive vegetation, but further experimental and molecular studies are needed to explain these contrasting niche patterns fully. Our study illustrates the need and benefit of applying large-scale, temporally explicit approaches to understanding biological invasions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Broennimann, O.; Guisan, A.; Mráz, P.; Müller-Schärer, H.; Petitpierre, B.","","41",2014,"Centaurea stoebe; Herbarium records; Human disturbances; Invasion routes; Niche conservatism; Niche limits; North America; Plant invasions; Spotted knapweed; Temporal data","","","","","","","","",""

However, extinct horses that varied in these three traits overlapped geographically for millions of years during the Miocene and Pliocene. It has been hypothesized that co-occurring horse species partitioned habitats, with large-bodied, hypsodont, and monodactyl equids dominating open grasslands, while equids with different combinations of traits lived in more wooded areas. We tested for the presence of broad-scale habitat partitioning by compiling a large database of North American horse fossil occurrences with data on trait state (body size, hypsodonty index, and toe number) and paleoenvironment (derived from paleovegetation records). Null modeling of niche overlap in each of the North American Land Mammal Ages of the Miocene and Pliocene revealed that taxonomic and trait-based groups show no differences in habitat occupancy. Cluster dendrograms visualizing niche overlap showed that some ecological guilds shared derived traits, but derived traits were not associated exclusively with grassland habitats. Trait values are not predicted by the proportion of grassland habitats in time bins. Further, the three traits show no co-evolution across the equid tree when corrected for phylogenetic relatedness. Together, these results suggest that the evolution of large body size, hypsodonty, and monodactyly in equids was not due to a shared selective regime in response to expanding grassland habitats; instead, these traits may have evolved separately, likely due to a variety of small-scale selective pressures acting across the variety of habitats present in the Miocene and Pliocene. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","McHorse, B.K.; Parker, A.K.; Pierce, S.E.","","511",2018,"Equidae; Hypsodonty; Miocene; Monodactyly; Paleoenvironment; Pliocene","","","","","","","","",""

This perception has been influential in framing the debate over conservation and land use in the northern Chihuahuan Desert. The lack of an evolutionary history of large grazers is being used to challenge the validity of ranching as a conservation strategy and to limit the protection and reintroduction of bison as a significant component of desert grassland ecosystems. Archeological records and historical accounts from Mexican archives from AD 700 to the 19th century document that the historic range of the bison included northern Mexico and adjoining areas in the United States. The Janos-Hidalgo bison herd, one of the few free-ranging bison herds in North America, has moved between Chihuahua, Mexico, and New Mexico, United States, since at least the 1920s. The persistence of this cross-border bison herd in Chihuahuan Desert grasslands and shrublands demonstrates that the species can persist in desert landscapes. Additional lines of evidence include the existence of grazing-adapted grasslands and the results of experimental studies that document declines in vegetation density and diversity following the removal of large grazers. The Janos-Hidalgo herd was formed with animals from various sources at the turn of the 19th century. Yet the future of the herd is compromised by differing perceptions of the ecological and evolutionary role of bison in the Desert Grasslands of North America. In Mexico they are considered native and are protected by federal law, whereas in New Mexico, they are considered non-native livestock and therefore lack conservation status or federal protection. Evidence written in Spanish of the presence of bison south of the accepted range and evidence from the disciplines of archaeology and history illustrate how differences in language and academic disciplines, in addition to international boundaries, have acted as barriers in shaping comprehensive approaches to conservation.

Although fossil remains have been reported from 33 localities, their evolutionary and dispersal history is still poorly understood. Here we give an overview of sites and records and discuss temporal ranges and some aspects of the dispersal history. The branch of cricetids that gave rise to the Microtoscoptini is still unknown. The currently oldest records are those of Microtoscoptes from Shala in China, considered 8 to 9 Ma and correlated with MN 10 or MN 11. All other remains from Eurasia are distinctly younger (MN 11 – MN 13). The earliest North American records of Paramicrotoscoptes and Goniodontomys are from the early Hemphillian beginning at 9.0 Ma (approximately MN 10 – MN 11 transition). Whether Microtoscoptes from Shala actually indicates the origin of Microtoscoptini in Asia and subsequent dispersal to North America is still unclear. The presence of Microtoscoptini in both Central Asia and North America during the Late Miocene does suggest dispersal through Beringia. The Microtoscoptini inhabited probably open grasslands locally differentiated by shrubs, tree patches and water bodies.

Plant associations with no modern analog were widespread until 12 ka. Most arboreal taxa expanded northward, but the timing and patterns of change varied widely among taxa. For example, some temperate arboreal taxa peaked in abundance during the late glacial period, whereas others continued to expand during the Holocene. Vegetation changes during the Younger Dryas chronozone apparently were widespread, but many older northeastern North America records are not dated well enough to confidently establish correlations. Moisture availability was a primary driver of Holocene shifts in forest composition and the position of the prairie-forest ecotone.

To assess divergence and test for hybridization between the 2 subspecies, we sampled breeding and wintering populations and collected morphological data, mitochondrial DNA sequences from the ND2 locus, and nuclear DNA sequences from genomic libraries enriched for ultraconserved elements (UCEs). Mitochondrial haplotypes were reciprocally monophyletic between the 2 subspecies and indicated divergence approximately 700,000 yr ago. The UCE dataset included 4,635 loci containing 19,322 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and, based on these data, individuals clustered by subspecies with no evidence of admixture between them and no substructure within subspecies. We identified 42 nuclear loci that contained SNPs fixed for alternate alleles between the 2 subspecies. Of the 42 loci with fixed differences, a statistically disproportional 17 were Z-linked, indicating a role for sexual selection in the divergence of the 2 subspecies.

These oscillations are indicative of climate-fuel-fire cycles that have prevailed on the Northern Great Plains (NGP) for most of the late Holocene. High charcoal flux occurred during past moist intervals when grass cover was extensive and fuel loads were high, whereas reduced charcoal flux characterized the intervening droughts when grass cover, and hence fuel loads, decreased, illustrating that fire is not a universal feature of the NGP through time but oscillates with climate. Spectral and wavelet analyses reveal that the cycles have a periodicity of ≈160 yr, although secular trends in the cycles are difficult to identify for the entire Holocene because the periodicity in the early Holocene ranged between 80 and 160 yr. Although the cycles are evident for most of the last 4,500 yr, their occasional muting adds further to the overall climatic complexity of the plains. These findings clearly show that the continental interior of North America has experienced short-term climatic cycles accompanied by a marked landscape response for several millennia, regularly alternating between dual landscape modes. The documentation of cycles of similar duration at other sites in the NGP, western North America, and Greenland suggests some degree of regional coherence to climatic forcing.

By using a multilocus statistical phylogeographic approach to examine diversity within a North American snake, Lampropeltis calligaster, we find that mode and timing of speciation near the Mississippi River embayment and peninsular Florida, two main biodiversity hotspots in eastern North America, challenge previously held notions of strict vicariance as the causal factor behind patterns of divergence seen among taxa at these locations. We found three species inhabiting distinct ecological niches with divergences dating to the mid- and early-Pleistocene with subsequently stable or increasing effective population sizes, further supporting the idea that the Pleistocene was an important driver of diversification in North America. Our results lead to a revised hypothesis that ecological divergence has occurred in this group across environments associated with the Mississippi River and at the Florida peninsula. Importantly, in their western distributions, we show that species divergence is associated with the ecological transition from distinct forested habitats to grasslands, rather than the nearby Mississippi River, a barrier often implicated for many other organisms. Additionally, we stress the importance of examining each delimited lineage with respect to conservation, since ecological niche models suggest that by the end of the century changes in climate may negatively alter habitat suitability and, barring adaptation, substantially reduce the suitable range of two of the three species we identified. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Burbrink, F.T.; McKelvy, A.D.","","106",2017,"Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecological speciation; Environmental niche modeling; Snakes; Statistical phylogeography","","","","","","","","",""

Dune field activity reflects decade-to-century-scale dominance of drought that exceeded historic conditions, with a growing season deficit of precipitation > 25%. The largest dune fields, the Nebraska Sand Hills and ergs in eastern Colorado, Kansas and the Southern High Plains showed peak activity sometime between ca. 7 and 5 cal. ka. Loess deposition between ca. 10 and 4 cal. ka also signifies widespread aridity. Most dune fields exhibit evidence for one or more reactivation events sometime in the past 2 cal. ka; a number of localities register two events post 1 cal. ka, the latest potentially after 1400 AD. However, there is not a clear association of the latest dune remobilization events with up to 13 droughts in the past 2 cal. ka identified in dendroclimatic and lacustrine records. Periods of persistent drought are associated with a La Niña-dominated climate state, with cooling of sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean and later of the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico that significantly weakens cyclogenesis over central North America. As drought proceeds, reduced soil moisture and vegetation cover would lessen evaporative cooling and increase surface temperatures. These surface changes strengthen the eastward expansion of a high-pressure ridge aloft and shift the jet stream northward, further enhancing continent-wide drought. Uncertainty persists if dune fields will reactivate in the future at a scale similar to the Holocene because of widespread irrigation, the lack of migratory bison herds, and the suppression of prairie fires, all of which enhance stabilization of dune fields in the Great Plains. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Forman, S.L.; Oglesby, R.; Webb, R.S.","","29",2001,"Droughts; Dune fields; Great Plains; Holocene climate; USA","","","","","","","","",""

Species richness declined more in communities with higher precipitation (r2 =0.81) and where encroachment was associated with a greater change in annual net primary productivity (ANPP; r2 =0.69). Based on the strong positive correlation between precipitation and ANPP following encroachment (r2 =0.87), we hypothesize that these relationships occur because water-limited woody plants experience a greater physiological and demographic release as precipitation increases.

The proposed cause of this habitat shift is the transition from the relatively low-seasonality early Miocene climate to a more highly seasonal climate regime by the end of the Miocene. Tusks, which are highly modified incisor teeth, of late Miocene Gomphotherium (Mammalia, Proboscidea) were sectioned to document the nature of tusk growth in this genus and to test for patterns of seasonal growth. Both the dentin and enamel of Gomphotherium tusks preserve incremental growth lines. Dentin has increments on three scales, inferred to represent annual (first-order), weekly (second-order), and daily (third-order) periodicities. Luminance and second-order increment thickness profiles were measured on transverse thin sections of tusk dentin viewed at low magnification, and the data were examined with bivariate plots and autocorrelation. Autocorrelograms of luminance data support the consistent identification and measurement of second-order increments within and among the tusks sampled. Profiles of second-order increment thickness in three tusks from the Barstovian North America Land Mammal Age (NALMA) show no indication of seasonal patterns of growth. One tusk from the late Clarendonian and one from the early Hemphillian NALMA have patterns of growth consistent with an increase in seasonality during the late Miocene, an interpretation supported by autocorrelation of the increment thickness data from these tusks. The growth patterns are consistent with the hypothesized changes in North American climate during the late Miocene and are suggestive of an increase in aridity and development of a wet season. Tests of this hypothesis are suggested. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.","Fox, D.L.","","156",2000,"Miocene; North America; Paleoclimate; Proboscidea; Seasonality","","","","","","","","",""

Generic circumscription of Asclepias has been long debated with recent workers favoring delimitation on geographic grounds; Asclepias s. s. is limited to the Americas and only segregate genera are recognized for African species. A widely used system introduced by Woodson classifies North American Asclepias into nine subgenera, with the largest subgenus, Asclepias, further divided into eight series. We investigated the phylogeny of Asclepias using three noncoding loci from the plastid genome: rpl16 intron, trnC GCA rpoB spacer, and the adjacent trnS GCU trnG uuc spacer and trnG uuc intron. Parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian analyses were conducted to evaluate hypotheses of continental and taxonomic monophyly. Hypothesis tests were conducted under the parsimony and likelihood criteria. We found moderate support for the monophyly of American Asclepias s. s. and for all but one representative of African Asclepias s. l. Within the Amerian clade, South American species are strongly supported as monophyletic and derived from North American ancestors. Only one of Woodson's 17 infrageneric taxa was found to be monophyletic. Monophyly of more than one half of the remaining 16 taxa could be statistically rejected using a conservative α level. Our results are consistent with taxonomic restriction of Asclepias to American species and single colonization events from Africa to North America and North America to South America. They also point to a need for major restructuring of infrageneric classification and future revsionary work. © Copyright 2011 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.","Chuba, D.; Ellison, C.; Fishbein, M.; Lynch, S.P.; Mason-Gamer, R.J.","","36",2011,"Africa; America; biogeography; classification; hypothesis test; milkweed","","","","","","","","",""

Mesowear trends in horses are reflective of global cooling and associated vegetation changes. There is a strong correlation between mesowear and crown height in horses; however, most horse paleopopulations had highly variable amounts of dietary abrasion, suggesting that selective pressures for crown height may have been weak much of the time. However, instances of higher abrasion were observed in some paleopopulations, suggesting intervals of stronger selection for the evolution of dentitions, including the early Miocene shortly before the first appearance of Equinae, the horse subfamily in which high-crowned dentitions evolved.","Mihlbachler, M.C.; Rivals, F.; Semprebon, G.M.; Solounias, N.","","331",2011,"","","","","","","","","",""

Features commonly shared among grasslands are climates with periodic droughts, landscapes that are level to gently rolling, high abundances of grazing animals, and frequent fires. World-wide expansion of grasslands occurred 8 to 6 MaBP and was associated with increasing abundance of grasses using the C4 photosynthetic pathway, a decline in woodlands, and coevolution of mammals adapted to grazing and open habitats. Beginning with Transeau's seminal paper on the prairie peninsula in 1935, North American ecologists debated the relative importance of fire and climate in determining the distribution of grasslands. In the 1960's, a major research interest was the response of prairies to fire, especially the productivity of burned and unburned grasslands. Understanding mechanisms for increased productivity on burned prairies began in the late 1960's and continued into the middle 1980's. During the past 20 to 25 years, grassland research has focused on the coevolution of grasses and mammalian grazers and fire-grazing interactions that affect habitat heterogeneity and diversity across trophic levels.

We found that the invasive genotype was a better competitor than either the native or the ancestral genotype. Further, the invasive genotype exhibited greater induced resistance but lower constitutive resistance than the ancestral and native genotypes.

Luminescence and radiocarbon ages for periods of dune accumulation and stability are compared with palaeoenvironment proxies to provide an assessment of the boundary conditions of dune system response to changes in sediment supply, availability, and mobility. Dune fields in the northern Great Plains were formed from sediment originating from glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine sediments deposited during deglaciation 16–11 ka. Subsequent aeolian deposition occurred in Parkland and Prairie dune fields as a result of mid-Holocene (8–5 ka) and late-Holocene (<3.5 ka) activity related to drought conditions that reworked pre-existing aeolian sands. In the Central Great Plains, many dune fields are closely linked to fluvial sediment sources. Sediment supply was high during deglaciation of the Rocky Mountains and resulted in widespread dune construction 16–10 ka. Multiple periods of Holocene reactivation are recorded and reflect increased sediment availability during drought episodes. Dune fields in the southwestern deserts experienced periods of construction as a result of enhanced supply of sediment from fluvial and lacustrine sources during the period 11.8–8 ka and at intervals during the late Holocene centered on 1.5, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 ka.

To this end, two CRCM5 simulations driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis for the 1981–2010 period are performed, where snow cover and depth are prescribed (uncoupled) in one simulation while they evolve interactively (coupled) during model integration in the second one. Results indicate systematic influence of snow cover and snow depth variability on the inter-annual variability of soil and air temperatures during winter and spring seasons. Inter-annual variability of air temperature is larger in the coupled simulation, with snow cover and depth variability accounting for 40–60% of winter temperature variability over the Mid-west, Northern Great Plains and over the Canadian Prairies. The contribution of snow variability reaches even more than 70% during spring and the regions of high snow-temperature coupling extend north of the boreal forests. The dominant process contributing to the snow-atmosphere coupling is the albedo effect in winter, while the hydrological effect controls the coupling in spring. Snow cover/depth variability at different locations is also found to affect extremes. For instance, variability of cold-spell characteristics is sensitive to snow cover/depth variation over the Mid-west and Northern Great Plains, whereas, warm-spell variability is sensitive to snow variation primarily in regions with climatologically extensive snow cover such as northeast Canada and the Rockies. Furthermore, snow-atmosphere interactions appear to have contributed to enhancing the number of cold spell days during the 2002 spring, which is the coldest recorded during the study period, by over 50%, over western North America.

Regional contributions to the terrestrial hydrologic budget, however, have been far from constant in the past as distribution of vegetation changed dramatically. The rise of grass-dominated ecosystems is one of the most profound paleoecological changes in the Cenozoic. Why then, would grassland expansion not feature prominently in the record of Neogene hydrologic change? Despite numerous stable isotope paleoenvironmental studies in Neogene North America, the contributions of land cover change have been largely ignored. We present a compilation of 16 oxygen isotope studies of pedogenic carbonate and smectite from western North America, including 4 new records. Nearly all records from California, the Basin and Range, the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains show increases in δO18 on the order of 2-6‰. In order to assess the role of ET in the hydrologic cycle, we developed an isotopic water vapor transport model wherein we manipulated ET parameters along a specified air mass trajectory. Grasslands lead to δO18 of precipitation (δOp18) values that are up to 5‰ greater than broadleaf and needleleaf vegetation at inland study sites. These results demonstrate that changes in vegetation played a critical role in establishing the modern hydrologic regime in western North America. We suggest that this isotopic increase is due to three primary reasons: 1) Increased evaporation and transpiration fluxes in grassland regions affect water balance, 2) Shallower rooting depths of grasses lead to the transpiration of soil water enriched in O18 due to evaporation, and 3) Grasslands transpire O18-rich waters during a shorter, more punctuated growing season. We argue that the observed isotope signals are indicative of a feedback mechanism wherein grasslands not only respond to regional and global climatic trends, but also act as a driver of hydrologic change. By enhancing seasonality and aridity, grasslands transmit hydrologic disturbances downstream, engineering climatic conditions favorable for their expansion. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Mix, H.T.; Mulch, A.; Page Chamberlain, C.; Winnick, M.J.","","377-378",2013,"Evapotranspiration; Grassland; Neogene; Oxygen isotopes; Paleoclimate","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying the most appropriate framework for restoring grasslands is dependent on the objectives of restoration, which is inherently determined by human priorities. Debates over the appropriate conservation model for grasslands have often focused on which species of herbivores should be the focus of restoration efforts. Here we discuss three perspectives of herbivore-based conservation in North American grasslands. First, the Pleistocene rewilding perspective is based upon the idea that early humans contributed to the demise of megafauna that were important to the evolution and development of many of North America's grasslands; therefore, their aim of restoration is rewilding of landscapes to pre-human times. Second, the bison rewilding perspective considers American bison a keystone herbivore that is culturally and ecologically important to North American grasslands. A third perspective focuses on restoring the pattern and processes of herbivory on grasslands and is less concerned about which herbivore is introduced to the landscape. We evaluate each of these three conservation perspectives in terms of a framework that includes a human domain, an herbivore domain and a biophysical domain. While all conservation perspectives partly address the three domains, they all fall short in key areas. Specifically, they fail to recognize that past, current and future humans are intimately linked to grassland patterns and processes and will continue to play a role in structuring grasslands. Furthermore, these perspectives seem to only superficially consider the role of fragmentation and climate change in influencing grassland patterns and processes. As such, we argue that future grassland conservation efforts must depend on the development of a model that better integrates societal, economic and policy objectives and recognizes climate change, fragmentation and humans as an integral part of these ecosystems. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Davis, C.A.; Elmore, R.D.; Fuhlendorf, S.D.; Goodman, L.E.; Hamilton, R.G.","","373",2018,"Biodiversity; Bison; Conservation; Fire; Grazing; Pleistocene rewilding","","","","","","","","",""

Climate variability and change can impact the hydrology and ecology of the region with implications for waterfowl populations. The historical relationship between PPR wetlands, duck populations, and seasonal hydroclimate are explored. Model experiments from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project are used to determine whether a recent wetting trend is due to natural variability or changing climate and how PPR hydroclimate will change into the future. Year-to-year variations in May duck populations, pond numbers, and the Palmer drought severity index are well correlated over past decades. Pond and duck numbers tend to increase in spring following La Niña events, but the correlation is not strong. Model simulations suggest that the strengthening of the precipitation gradient across the PPR over the past century is predominantly due to natural variability and therefore could reverse. Model projections of future climate indicate precipitation will increase across the PPR in all seasons except summer, but this gain for surface moisture is largely offset by increased evapotranspiration because of higher temperatures and increased atmospheric evaporative demand. In summer, the combined effects of warming and precipitation changes indicate seasonal surface drying in the future.

However, there are surprisingly few empirical studies that distinguish the effect of environmental variability from the effects of population processes. We took advantage of a unique system, in which populations of the same duck species or close ecological counterparts live in highly variable (north American prairies) and in stable (north European lakes) environments, to distinguish the relative contributions of environmental variability (measured as between-year fluctuations in wetland numbers) and intraspecific interactions (density dependence) in driving population dynamics. We tested whether populations living in stable environments (in northern Europe) were more strongly governed by density dependence than populations living in variable environments (in North America). We also addressed whether relative population dynamical responses to environmental variability versus density corresponded to differences in life history strategies between dabbling (relatively “fast species” and governed by environmental variability) and diving (relatively “slow species” and governed by density) ducks. As expected, the variance component of population fluctuations caused by changes in breeding environments was greater in North America than in Europe. Contrary to expectations, however, populations in more stable environments were not less variable nor clearly more strongly density dependent than populations in highly variable environments. Also, contrary to expectations, populations of diving ducks were neither more stable nor stronger density dependent than populations of dabbling ducks, and the effect of environmental variability on population dynamics was greater in diving than in dabbling ducks. In general, irrespective of continent and species life history, environmental variability contributed more to variation in species abundances than did density. Our findings underscore the need for more studies on populations of the same species in different environments to verify the generality of current explanations about population dynamics and its association with species life history. © 2016 The Authors.

The controversies in the 1960s and 1970s that swirled around indiscriminate use of agricultural chemicals-their long-term ecological harm versus food production benefits-were sparked and clarified by biologist Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962). This seminal publication challenged long-held assumptions concerning the industrial might of American agriculture while sounding an alarm for the damaging persistence of pesticides, especially chlorinated hydrocarbons such as DDT, in the larger environment. In Chemical Lands: Pesticides, Aerial Spraying, and Health in North America’s Grasslands since 1945 David D. Vail shows, however, that a distinctly regional view of agricultural health evolved. His analysis reveals a particularly strong ethic in the North American grasslands where practitioners sought to understand and deploy insecticides and herbicides by designing local scientific experiments, engineering more precise aircraft sprayers, developing more narrowly specific chemicals, and planting targeted test crops. Their efforts to link the science of toxicology with environmental health reveal how the practitioners of pesticides evaluated potential hazards in the agricultural landscape while recognizing the production benefits of controlled spraying. Chemical Lands adds to a growing list of books on toxins in the American landscape. This study provides a unique Grasslands perspective of the Ag pilots, weed scientists, and farmers who struggled to navigate novel technologies for spray planes and in the development of new herbicides/insecticides while striving to manage and mitigate threats to human health and the environment. © 2018 by the University of Alabama Press.

The southern edges of ranges in mountain species may not shift northwards during warming as populations instead migrate up available elevational gradients; overall latitudinal range appears therefore to expand. In contrast, flatland species should shift range centroids northwards but not expand or contract their latitudinal range extent. These hypotheses were tested utilizing Late Pleistocene and modern occurrence data. Location: North America. Methods: The location and elevation of modern and Late Pleistocene species occurrences were collected from data bases for 26 species living in mountain or flatland environments. Regressions of elevation change over latitude, and southern and northern range edges were calculated for each species for modern and fossil data sets. A combination of regressions and anova s were used to test whether flatland species shift range edges and latitudinal extents more than mountain species do. Results: Flatland species had significantly larger northward shifts at southern range edges than did mountain-dwelling species from the Late Pleistocene to the present. There was also a significant negative correlation between the amount of change in the latitude of the southern edge of the range and the amount of elevational shifting from the Late Pleistocene to the present. Although significant, only c. 25% of the variance could be explained by this relationship. In addition, there was a weak indication that overall range expansion was less in flatland-dwelling than in mountain-dwelling species. Main conclusions: The approach used here was to examine past species' range responses to warming that occurred after the last ice ages as a means to better predict potential future responses to continued warming. The results confirm predictions of differential southern edge and overall range shifts for species occupying mountain and flatland regions in North America. The findings may be broadly applicable in other regions, thus allowing better modelling of future range and distribution related responses. © 2006 The Author Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Guralnick, R.","","16",2007,"Climate variability; Elevational gradients; Faunmap; Globa lwarming; Latitudinal gradients; Species climate response; Species elevation distribution; Species range","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed three nested data sets separately: (1) all turtles, (2) freshwater turtles, and (3) aquatic turtles. We georeferenced North American turtle distributions, then we created presence-absence matrices for each of the three data sets. We used watershed unit as biogeographic units. We conducted an unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean clustering analysis on each Jaccard index distance matrix from our watershed species matrices to delineate biogeographic provinces. Provinces were then tested for significant differences in species compositions in a global model with the use of a one-way analysis of similarity. We conducted a best subset of environmental variables with maximum (rank) correlation with community dissimilarities that determined the best model of abiotic variables explaining province delineation (i.e., climate, topography, and stream channel). To identify which species contributed the most to province delineations, we conducted an indicator species analysis and a similarity-percentage analysis. There were 16 all-turtle provinces, 15 freshwater provinces, and 13 aquatic provinces. Species compositions delineating the provinces were explained by abiotic variables, including mean annual precipitation, mean precipitation seasonality, and diversity of streams. Province delineations correspond closely with geographical boundaries, many of which have Pleistocene origins. For example, rivers with a history of carrying glacial runoff (e.g., Arkansas, Mississippi) sometimes dissect upland provinces, especially for aquatic and semiaquatic turtles. Compared with freshwater fishes, turtles show greater sensitivity to decreased temperature with restriction of most taxa south of the last permafrost maximum. Turtles also exhibit higher sensitivity to climatic, geomorphic, and tectonic instability, with richness and endemism concentrated along the more stable Gulf of México and Atlantic (south of the last permafrost maximum) coasts. Although distribution data indicate two aquatic turtles are most cold tolerant (i.e., Chrysemys picta, Chelydra serpentina), aquatic turtles overall show the most restriction to warmer, wetter climates. Sequential addition of semiaquatic and terrestrial turtles into analyses shows, as expected, that these taxa flesh out turtle faunas in climatically harsh (e.g., grasslands) or remote (e.g., California, Sonoran Desert) regions. The turtle assemblages of southwestern versus southeastern North America are distinct. But there is a transition zone across the semiarid plains of the Texas Gulf Coast, High Plains, and Chihuahuan Desert, including a strong boundary congruent with the Cochise Filter-Barrier.

With global change altering all three factors, understanding how grasslands respond to changes in these combined drivers may aid in projecting future changes in grassland ecosystems. We manipulated rainfall and simulated grazing (clipping) in two long-term fire experiments in mesic grasslands in North America (NA) and South Africa (SA). Despite their common drivers, grasslands in NA and SA differ in evolutionary history. Therefore, we expected community structure and production in NA and SA to respond differently to fire, grazing, and drought. Specifically, we hypothesized that NA plant community composition and production would be more responsive than the SA plant communities to changes in the drivers and their interactions, and that despite this expected stability of SA grasslands, drought would be the dominant factor controlling production, but grazing would play the primary role in determining community composition at both sites. Contrary to our hypothesis, NA and SA grasslands generally responded similarly to grazing, drought, and fire. Grazing increased diversity, decreased grass cover and production, and decreased belowground biomass at both sites. Drought alone minimally impacted plant community structure, and we saw similar treatment interactions at the two sites. Drought was not the primary driver of grassland productivity, but instead drought effects were similar to or less than grazing and fire. Even though these grasslands differed in evolutionary history, they responded similarly to our fire, grazing, and climate manipulations. Overall, we found community and ecosystem convergence in NA and SA grasslands.

The region supported a mosaic of forest and prairie habitats inhabited by a ""Floridian"" ice-age biota. Plant and vertebrate remains suggest an ecological gradient towards Cape Hatteras (35°N) wherein forests tended to replace prairies, and browsing proboscideans tended to replace grazing proboscideans. Beyond 35°N, warm waters of the Gulf Stream were deflected towards the central Atlantic, and a cold-facies biota replaced ""Floridian"" biota on the Atlantic coastal plain. Because of niche diversity and relatively benign climate, biodiversity may have been greater in the south-eastern thermal enclave than in other unglaciated areas of North America. However, the impact of terminal Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions may also have been shorter and more severe in the enclave than further north.

Moisture delivered to the Great Plains varies seasonally and predominately derives from the Gulf of Mexico/Atlantic Ocean with minor contributions from the Pacific Ocean and Arctic region. For this work, we evaluate long-term relationships for the past ~35million years between North American hydrology, climate, and floral change, using isotopic records and average carbon chain lengths of higher plant n-alkanes from Gulf of Mexico sediments (DSDP Site 94). We find that carbon isotope values (δ13C) of n-alkanes, corrected for variations in the δ13C value of atmospheric CO2, provide minor evidence for contributions of C4 plants prior to the Middle Miocene. A sharp spike in C4 input is identified during the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum, and the influence of C4 plants steadily increased during the Late Miocene into the Pleistocene - consistent with other North American records. Chain-length distributions of n-alkanes, indicative of the composition of higher plant communities, remained remarkably constant from 33 to 4Ma. However, a trend toward longer chain lengths occurred during the past 4million years, concurrent with an increase in δ13C values, indicating increased C4 plant influence and potentially aridity. The hydrogen isotope values (δD) of n-alkanes are relatively invariant between 33 and 9Ma, and then become substantially more negative (75‰) from 9 to 2Ma. Changes in the plant community and temperature of precipitation can solely account for the observed variations in δD from 33 to 5Ma, but cannot account for Plio-Pleistocene δD variations and imply substantial changes in the source region of precipitation and seasonality of moisture delivery. We posit that hydrological changes were linked to tectonic and oceanographic processes including the shoaling and closure of the Panamanian Seaway, amplification of North Atlantic Deep Water Production and an associated increase of meridional winds. The southerly movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone near 4Ma allowed for the development of a near-modern pressure/storm track system, driving increased aridity and changes in seasonality within the North American interior. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Pagani, M.; Tipple, B.J.","","299",2010,"Carbon isotopes; Cenozoic; DSDP Site 94; Gulf of Mexico; Hydrogen isotopes; N-alkanes","","","","","","","","",""

Over the west-central Prairie Provinces, well below normal precipitation was recorded for a remarkable eight consecutive seasons from autumn 2000 to summer 2002. Analysis of the mid-tropospheric circulation during these droughts indicates that the patterns were markedly different from those associated with the severe, multi-season Prairie droughts of 1961 and 1988. In particular, the circulation during 2001 and 2002 lacked the distinct meridional flow over the North Pacific and North America that has been associated with previous dry periods over western Canada. Moreover, the evolution and persistence of the 2001–2002 droughts have no clear relationships with large-scale teleconnection patterns that have influenced past climate extremes over western regions of the country. Results suggest that the recent droughts may be related to a northward extension of persistent drought producing circulation anomalies that influenced the continental United States.

The first grass-dominated communities (probably early Tertiary) were tropical savannas in seasonally-flooded lowlands in tropical deciduous forests or in coastal marshes. Late Oligocene-Miocene mountain uplifts established the modern climatic regimes and biogeographical provinces, segregated plants into communities limited by environmental extremes, and stimulated radiations. Desert grasslands formed c9000 yr BP as woodland plants retreated to high elevations. Grassland species responded to Holocene climatic changes as individuals rather than as communities.

Their success stems from a physiological CO 2-concentrating pump, which leads to high photosynthetic efficiency in warm climates and low atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Remarkably, their dominance of tropical environments was achieved in only the past 10 million years (Myr), less than 3% of the time that terrestrial plants have existed on Earth. We critically review the proposal that declining atmospheric CO2 triggered this tropical revolution via its effects on the photosynthetic efficiency of leaves. Our synthesis of the latest geological evidence from South Asia and North America suggests that this emphasis is misplaced. Instead, we find important roles for regional climate change and fire in South Asia, but no obvious environmental trigger for C4 success in North America. CO2-starvation is implicated in the origins of C4 plants 25-32 Myr ago, raising the possibility that the pathway evolved under more extreme atmospheric conditions experienced 10 times earlier. However, our geochemical analyses provide no evidence of the C4 mechanism at this time, although possible ancestral components of the C 4 pathway are identified in ancient plant lineages.

Our aim was to characterize the geographic origins of two Plasmodium parasite lineages detected in the Galapagos Islands and in North American breeding bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) that regularly stop in Galapagos during migration to their South American overwintering sites. We used samples from a grassland breeding bird assemblage in Nebraska, United States, and parasite DNA sequences from the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, to compare to global data in a DNA sequence registry. Homologous DNA sequences from parasites detected in bobolinks and more sedentary birds (e.g., brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus ater, and other co-occurring bird species resident on the North American breeding grounds) were compared to those recovered in previous studies from global sites. One parasite lineage that matched between Galapagos birds and the migratory bobolink, Plasmodium lineage B, was the most common lineage detected in the global MalAvi database, matching 49 sequences from unique host/site combinations, 41 of which were of South American origin. We did not detect lineage B in brown-headed cowbirds. The other Galapagos-bobolink match, Plasmodium lineage C, was identical to two other sequences from birds sampled in California. We detected a close variant of lineage C in brown-headed cowbirds. Taken together, this pattern suggests that bobolinks became infected with lineage B on the South American end of their migratory range, and with lineage C on the North American breeding grounds. Overall, we detected more parasite lineages in bobolinks than in cowbirds. Galapagos Plasmodium had similar host breadth compared to the non-Galapagos haemosporidian lineages detected in bobolinks, brown-headed cowbirds, and other grassland species. This study highlights the utility of global haemosporidian data in the context of migratory bird-parasite connectivity. It is possible that migratory bobolinks bring parasites to the Galapagos and that these parasites originate from different biogeographic regions representing both their breeding and overwintering sites.

In this study, an isotopically equipped atmospheric general circulation model (isoGSM) is used to investigate how divergent phases of the PNA affect precipitation δ18O values across the United States. A simulation using observational climate and isotope data over the United States is evaluated first. The simulation explains 84%of the spatial variability of winter precipitation δ18O, with an overestimation in the northern Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes. Temporally, the simulation explains 29%-81% of the interannual variability of winter precipitation δ18O, with typically a higher explained variance in the east than the west. The modeled winter precipitation δ18O exhibits a clear northwest-southeast (NW-SE) dipolelike pattern in response to shifts in the PNA pattern, with the center of positive polarity in the northwestern United States and the Canadian prairies and the center of negative polarity over the Ohio River valley. This dipolelike spatial pattern is a result of the difference in atmospheric circulation and moisture sources associated with the PNA pattern. These results highlight the importance of the PNA-associated circulation dynamics in governing precipitation isotope patterns across the United States. This understanding improves our ability to interpret paleoclimate records of water isotope/hydrologic change across the United States with a much greater appreciation of regional traits.

We also determined the genetic distinctiveness of a population off the coast of southern California, Santa Barbara Island, as management plans to control the local owl population are being considered to decrease predation rate on the now threatened Scripps’s Murrelet (Synthliboramphus scrippsi). Using 8 polymorphic microsatellite markers (N = 126) and ND2 mitochondrial sequences (N = 37), we found little to no genetic structure among all sampled regions, with the exception of Santa Barbara Island. The BC mainland population, despite its northwestern geographically peripheral location and ongoing habitat degradation, is not genetically depauperate. However, individuals from Vancouver Island, likewise a peripheral population in BC, exhibited the lowest genetic diversity of all sampled locations.

Questions regarding what force drove the decrease in body size, however, continue to generate new hypotheses and the use of novel methodological approaches. While many variables influence body size, morphological changes in bison historically are attributed to either human hunting or climate change. New data from a sample of metapodials from well-dated Southern Plains localities depict a rapid decrease in body size in the early Holocene with modern size present by 6500 BP. The pattern and rate of evolution on the Southern Plains is compared to existing hypotheses for bison diminution over the Late Quaternary. Bison size on the Southern Plains correlates best with the spread of the C4 ecosystem between ca. 8000 and 6500 BP. C4 grasses are less nutritious than the C3 grasses they replaced and this decrease in nutritional value of the bison's primary food source likely led to the decrease in body size.

This builds upon previous studies that were limited to seasonal timescales. Here, a unique two-way statistical analysis is used to delineate linear SSTA-precipitation teleconnection patterns. First, a principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on a monthly tropical Pacific SSTA dataset for 1950-92 to identify the coherent modes of variability. The principal component (PC) score time series representing the most significant modes of SSTA variability (see below) ate then correlated on a calendar-monthly basis with station precipitation anomalies, yeilding associated ""correlation-based"" precipitation coherencies. In the second approach, PCA is applied to the precipitation anomaly data for each calendar month. Then, the resulting ""PC-based"" precipitation coherencies most central to each of the mahor correlation-based precipitation regions are indentified, and their associated PC score time series are subsequently correlated with the tropical Pacific SSTA grid-cell data, yielding correlation-based SSTA coherencies that are then compared (generally favorably) with their PC-based forerunners. The three SSTA PC patterns used to seek teleconnection signals in central and eastern North American precipitation are the first unrotated PC (UPC1, emphasizing central tropical Pacific variability), and the first (VPC1, eastern tropical Pacific) and second (VPC2, western to north central tropical Pacific) Varimax-rotated PCs. The strongest such signals to emerge were for precipitation in the southeastern United States (positive association with UPC1 and VPC1 in November-March), Texas (positive association with UPC1 and VPC1 in November-March), the Great Lakes/Ohio River region (negative association with UPC1 and VPC1 in January-March), the southeastern United States (negative association with UPC1 and VPC1 in July-August), the southern Canadian prairie (negative association with UPC1 and VPC1 in November-January), and along a northern storm track (positive associaton with VPC2 in September-October). These results, derived from new datasets using a unique statistical approach, both broadly confirm and significantly clarify previous findings and present striking new associations.","Montroy, D.L.","","10",1997,"","","","","","","","","",""

Leporid remains are common among material recovered from ongoing, systematic excavations at RSR-1. The size and morphology of collected lower third premolars were utilized to identify the leporid taxa present at RSR-1. The resulting sample assemblage is unique in composition, including: Hypolagus gidleyi, Hypolagus spp. (small form), Notolagus lepusculus, Nekrolagus progressus (including forms with the Lepus pattern), and Aztlanolagus agilis. The biochronology of such a combination of taxa indicates placement near the boundary between the early and late subdivisions of the Blancan Land Mammal Age, generally consistent with the current interpretation of RSR-1. The RSR-1 sample is considered against the backdrop of Neogene-Quaternary faunal turnover that included the extinction of the Archaeolaginae and radiation within the extant subfamily, Leporinae. Leporid abundance during the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene (Blancan Land Mammal Age) of North America marks peak species richness for the rabbit family. Late Miocene-early Pleistocene changes in climate and grassland composition and structure in North America coincide with this pivotal period of leporid natural history. Environmental shifts potentially created a period of expanded physical heterogeneity and niche diversification that provided the ecological conditions for archaeolagines, Blancan leporines, and emerging derived, modern type (Lepus pattern) leporines to widely coexist.

This extinct marten, a close relative of the extant American marten (Martes americana), is known from 18 sites in western North America, most dating to the late Pleistocene. Because boreal fauna were associated with the late-Pleistocene noble marten, researchers generally believed that it inhabited boreal forests like the American marten, and competition between the 2 may have caused its extinction. Recent discoveries of noble martens associated with xeric fauna from Holocene contexts have called these assumptions into question. I explore the adaptation and habitat of the noble marten with an analysis of its faunal associations and find-site locations. The analysis suggests that the noble marten was adapted to open, mesic grasslands in montane foothills, and was likely not sympatric with the American marten.

With climate warming and human occupation, it is anticipated that fire danger, ignition, and activity will be increasing, compromising forests’ benefits for generations to come. In this study, we show, however, that a century of rapid climate changes and human densification has had the opposite effect in the boreal eastern interior of the North American continent, reducing biomass burning to values below two millennia of historical levels. A multi-millennial fire history was reconstructed for eight forested landscapes from the Lake of the Woods Ecoregion (LWE) located at the boreal–prairie ecotone. Fire history was reconstructed using a combination of archival (period 1920–2010), tree-ring (stand initiations and fire scars: period 1690–2010), and lake sediment charcoal (2500 BP to present) records. The archival record revealed recent large fires (>200 ha) in 1948, 1980, and 1988. An additional 19 fires were identified by the fire-scar record. Fire events in 1805, 1840, 1863, and the 1890s were identified in numerous locations around multiple lakes suggesting that they were of large extents. In accordance with the tree-ring record, the charcoal accumulation rate (CHAR) peak record generally identified the major fires but tended to lag from the tree-ring records by several decades. Within LWE, the long-term charcoal record revealed that CHAR was higher for each lake in the earlier portion of the record including the warm Medieval Climate Anomaly (AD −900 to AD 1000), followed by a progressive decrease toward the cool Little Ice Age period. This decline was abruptly interrupted in the mid- to late 19th century with large synchronized fires, also reported over western and central North America, and resumed approximately four decades later. Fire disturbance level is today below the historical range, despite the accentuated climate warming. Aging of the forest landscape may create biodiversity loss notably in fire-adapted species while at the same time setting the tone for major fires in upcoming decades if no action is taken for managing fuels. © 2018 The Authors.","Ali, A.A.; Bergeron, Y.; Conciatori, F.; Girardin, M.P.; Tardif, J.C.; Waito, J.","","9",2018,"boreal–prairie ecotone; climate change; fire scars; lacustrine charcoal particles; millennial fire history; paleoecology; post-fire stand initiation; south-central Canada; tree-rings","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicate that different site types provide different perspectives on Paleoindian faunal use. Kill assemblages can only inform on the exploitation of large game, while the full variety of prey used by foragers is represented at camps. In contrast to prior claims, however, the inclusion of kill site assemblages in zooarchaeological analyses does not appear to bias our perspective of Paleoindian subsistence. Rather, there is strong indication that Paleoindian foragers targeted different types of prey depending on which habitat they occupied. In more-diverse environments of alluvial valleys and foothill/mountains, foragers exploited large game whenever possible, but they also targeted a suite of smaller prey items. In more uniform grassland environments, subsistence strategies focused almost exclusively on hunting large prey, such as bison and mammoth. These results also provide limited support for prior studies that argue for intensified resource use and increased diet breadth in response to early Holocene environmental changes, at least in certain settings. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Hill Jr., M.E.","","191",2008,"","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the importance of the ancient bison, little is known about its feeding ecology. We employed a combination of extended mesowear, and mesowear III to infer the dietary preference and habitat use of three Mexican samples of B. antiquus. These included two northern samples - La Piedad-Santa Ana and La Cinta-Portalitos - from the Transmexican Volcanic Belt morphotectonic Province, as well as one southern sample - Viko Vijin - from the Sierra Madre del Sur morphotectonic province. We found that the northern Mexican samples were primarily nonstrict grazers, whereas the southern sample displays a pattern consistent with mixed feeding habits. This suggests variability among the diets of the bison from these samples, caused by different paleoenvironments. This evidence complements the paleoenvironmental reconstructions in the studied localities; for the northern samples, open prairies composed of patches of woodland or shrubland and, for the southern locality, a fluvial floodplain with short-lived vegetation. In both scenarios, grasses (Poaceae) were nondominant.

There are no extant Old World vultures in the Americas today, although a large diversity of Gypaetinae is known from Miocene to late Pleistocene records. Despite a comparatively large number of North American gypaetine fossils, complete specimens have rarely been reported from Eurasia and Africa. We describe the exceptional skeleton of a new gypaetine vulture from the late Miocene deposits of the Linxia Basin in northwestern China. The specimen is the oldest record of Gypaetinae from Eurasia or Africa. A reexamination of the geographic and temporal distribution of most Old World vultures from Neogene deposits indicates a diverse radiation, coincident with early-to mid-Miocene grassland expansion for Gypaetinae. Although the diversification of Aegypiinae has been linked to the transition from C3 to C4 grassland, Gypaetinae diversification predates that transition in both North America and Asia. A shift in the known latitudinal distribution is also noted. Neogene records of Old World vultures are found primarily in mid-and high-latitude regions of North America and Eurasia as well as in the middle and low latitudes of Eurasia and Africa.

Because switchgrass is a native plant, it has been suggested that disease problems will be minimal, but little research in this area has been conducted. Recently, outbreaks of switchgrass anthracnose disease have been reported from the northeastern United States. Incidences of switchgrass anthracnose are known in North America since 1886 through herbarium specimens and disease reports, but the causal agent of this disease has never been experimentally determined or taxonomically evaluated. In the present work, we evaluate the causal agent of switchgrass anthracnose, a new species we describe as Colletotrichum navitas (navitas = Latin for energy).

However, thousands of sand dunes spread across 12,000 km2 in eastern upper Michigan (EUM), more than 500 km east of the present forest-prairie ecotone, present a challenge to such models. We use 65 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages on quartz sand deposited in silt caps (n = 8) and dunes (n = 57) to document eolian activity in EUM. Dune building was widespread ca. 10-8 ka, indicating a sharp, sustained decline in forest cover during that period. This decline was roughly coincident with hydrologic closure of the upper Great Lakes, but temporally inconsistent with most pollen-based models that imply canopy closure throughout the Holocene. Early Holocene forest openings are rarely recognized in pollen sums from EUM because faint signatures of non-arboreal pollen are largely obscured by abundant and highly mobile pine pollen. Early Holocene spikes in nonarboreal pollen are recorded in cores from small ponds, but suggest only a modest extent of forest openings.

DCA tended to provide better separation of some clusters than did NMDS in most of the analyses.

To better understand whether elevated N deposition has altered ecosystem structure or function in North American grasslands, we analyzed a 27-year record of ecophysiological, community, and ecosystem metrics for an annually burned Kansas tallgrass prairie. Over this time, despite increasing rates of N deposition that are within the range of critical loads for grasslands, there was no evidence of eutrophication. Plant N concentrations did not increase, soil moisture did not decline, forb diversity did not decline, and the relative abundance of dominant grasses did not shift toward more eutrophic species. Neither aboveground primary productivity nor N availability to plants increased. The fates of deposited N in grasslands are still uncertain, and could include management losses through burning and grazing.

The ANPP in the EASR was estimated from the Integrated ANPPNDVI model, which is an empirical model developed based on field-observed ANPP and long-term normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The optimal composite period of NDVI data was identified by considering spatial heterogeneities across the study area in the Integrated ANPPNDVI model. EASR's ANPP had apparent zonal patterns along hydrothermal gradients, and the mean annual value was 43.78 g C m−2 yr−1, which was lower than the global grasslands average. Compared to other important natural grasslands, EASR's ANPP was lower than the North American, South American, and African grasslands. The total aboveground net primary productivity (TANPP) was found to be 378.97 Tg C yr−1, which accounted for 8.18%–36.03% of the TANPP for all grasslands. In addition, EASR's TANPP was higher than that of the grasslands in North America, South America, and Africa. The EASR's TANPP increased in a fluctuating manner throughout the entire period of 1982–2013. The increasing trend was greater than that for North American and South American and was lower than that for African grasslands over the same period. The years 1995 and 2007 were two turning points at which trends in EASR's TANPP significantly changed. Our analysis demonstrated that the EASR has been playing a substantial and progressively more important role in global carbon sequestration.

Animal communities vary from phylogenetically clustered (i.e. higher relatedness amongst co-occurring species than is expected by chance) to phylogenetically even (i.e. co-occurring taxa are more distantly related than expected by chance), which is explained by abiotic or climatic filtering and competitive exclusion, respectively. Under this model, the contribution of historical origination and extinction events to modern animal PCS remains relatively unknown. Because origination and extinction determine the make-up of the terrestrial community, the study of historical changes in animal PCS is tantamount to understanding formation of modern communities. In the present study, we test the effects of macroevolution and climate changes on 'hoofed mammals' (i.e. perissodactyl and artiodactyl) PCS from the late Cenozoic of North America because they experience large, phylogenetically dispersed extinctions of browsing species and phylogenetically dispersed originations of grazing species associated with the evolution of grassland ecosystems during the late Miocene. We show that the loss of numerically dominant nonhypsodont (putatively browsing and mixed feeding) clades and phylogenetically dispersed origination of less speciose clades following the mid Miocene climatic optimum led to an increase in phylogenetic evenness at the regional scale that is well explained by global climate changes. Phylogenetic evenness and a reduced richness during the late Cenozoic may have facilitated reduced niche overlap among co-occurring hoofed mammal species as global climates cooled. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.","Fraser, D.; Gorelick, R.; Rybczynski, N.","","114",2015,"Artiodactyla; Composition; Extinction; Net relatedness index; Origination; Perissodactyla","","","","","","","","",""

Although the structure and ecological functioning of grasslands are strongly influenced by fire and grazing, the role of these key ecological drivers in the production and storage of silicon represents a significant knowledge gap, particularly since they are being altered worldwide by human activities. We evaluated the effects of fire and grazing on the range and variability of plant derived biogenic silica stored in plant biomass and soils by sampling plants and soils from long-term experimental plots with known fire and grazing histories. Overall, plants and soils from grazed sites in the South African ecosystems had up to 76 and 54% greater biogenic silica totals (kg ha-1), respectively, than grazed North American sites. In North American soils, the combination of grazing and annual fire resulted in the greatest abundance of biogenic silica, whereas South African soils had the highest biogenic silica content where grazed regardless of burn frequency. These results as well as those that show greater Si concentrations in grazed South African plants indicate that South African plants and soils responded somewhat differently to fire and grazing with respect to silicon cycling, which may be linked to differences in the evolutionary history and in the grazer diversity and grazing intensity of these ecosystems. We conclude that although fire and grazing (as interactive and/or independent factors) do not affect the concentration of Si taken up by plants, they do promote increased silicon storage in aboveground biomass and soil as a result of directly affecting other site factors such as aboveground net primary productivity. Therefore, as management practices, fire and grazing have important implications for assessing global change impacts on the terrestrial biogeochemical cycling of silicon. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Blair, J.M.; Kelly, E.F.; Kirkman, K.P.; Knapp, A.K.; Melzer, S.E.; Smith, M.D.","","97",2010,"Biogenic silica; North American grasslands; Soil; South African savannas; Terrestrial plants","","","","","","","","",""

However, evaluation of the long-standing hypotheses about the region's environmental history has been hampered by the scarcity of paleorecords. We conducted multiproxy analyses on early and middle Holocene sediments from two Illinois, USA, lakes to assess long-term climatic, vegetational, and fire variability in the region. Sediment mineral composition, carbonate δ18O, ostracode assemblages, and diatom assemblages were integrated to infer fluctuations in moisture availability. Pollen and charcoal δ13C were used to reconstruct vegetation composition, and charcoal influx was used to reconstruct fire. Results indicate that fire-sensitive trees (e.g., Ulmus, Ostrya, Fraxinus, and Acer saccharum) declined and prairie taxa expanded with increased aridity from 10 000 yr BP to 8500 yr BP. Between ∼8500 yr BP and ∼6200 yr BP, aridity declined, and prairie coexisted with fire-sensitive and fire-tolerant (e.g., Quercus and Carya) trees. After ∼6200 yr BP, prairie taxa became dominant, although aridity was not more severe than it was around 8500 yr BP. Along with aridity, fire appears to have played an important role in the establishment and maintenance of prairie communities in the eastern Prairie Peninsula, consistent with the speculations of the early ecologists.

The biodiversity consequences of these changes are still poorly understood. We experimentally separated the effects of primary productivity and herbivores of different body size on plant species richness across a 10-fold productivity gradient using a 7-year field experiment at seven grassland sites in North America and Europe. We show that assemblages including large herbivores increased plant diversity at higher productivity but decreased diversity at low productivity, while small herbivores did not have consistent effects along the productivity gradient.

Recent work suggests that historical fire frequency has been overestimated east of the prairie-woodland transition zone, and its introduction could potentially reduce forest herb and shrub diversity. Fire-history recreations derived from sedimentary charcoal, tree fire scars, and estimates of Native American burning suggest point-return times ranging from 5-10 years to centuries and millennia. Actual return times were probably longer because such records suffer from selective sampling, small sample sizes, and a probable publication bias toward frequent fire. Archeological evidence shows the environmental effect of fire could be severe in the immediate neighborhood of a Native American village. Population density appears to have been low through most of the Holocene, however, and villages were strongly clustered at a regional scale. Thus, it appears that the majority of forests of the eastern United States were little affected by burning before European settlement. Use of prescribed burning assumes that most forest species are tolerant of fire and that burning will have only a minimal effect on diversity. However, common adaptations such as serotiny, epicormic sprouting, resprouting from rhizomes, and smoke-cued germination are unknown across most of the deciduous region. Experimental studies of burning show vegetation responses similar to other forms of disturbance that remove stems and litter and do not necessarily imply adaptation to fire. The general lack of adaptation could potentially cause a reduction in diversity if burning were introduced. These observations suggest a need for a fine-grained examination of fire history with systematic sampling in which all subregions, landscape positions, and community types are represented. Responses to burning need to be examined in noncommercial and nonwoody species in rigorous manipulative experiments. Until such information is available, it seems prudent to limit the use of prescribed burning east of the prairie-woodland transition zone. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","Matlack, G.R.","","27",2013,"Adaptation; Charcoal; Fire scar; Native American; Oak; Vegetation history","","","","","","","","",""

Global Hg wildfire emissions are estimated to be 612 Mg year−1. Africa is the dominant source region (43.8% of global emissions), followed by Eurasia (31%) and South America (16.6%). We find significant perturbations to wildfire emissions of Hg in the context of global change, driven by the projected changes in climate, land use and land cover and Hg anthropogenic emissions. 2000–2050 climate change could increase Hg emissions by 14% globally and regionally by 18% for South America, 14% for Africa and 13% for Eurasia. Projected changes in land use by 2050 could decrease the global Hg emissions from wildfires by 13% mainly driven by a decline in African emissions due to significant agricultural land expansion. Future land cover changes could lead to significant increases in Hg emissions over some regions (+32% North America, +14% Africa, +13% Eurasia). Potential enrichment of terrestrial ecosystems in 2050 in response to changes in Hg anthropogenic emissions could increase Hg wildfire emissions globally (+28%) and regionally (+19% North America, +20% South America, +24% Africa, +41% Eurasia).

These data were then subjected to model-based cluster analysis and kmeans clustering to identify the main compositional groups and most important environmental covariables. Six primary compositional groups were identified. Three of these largely represent upland forest and rock outcrop sites, while the remaining largely represent either lowland forest, lowland grassland or upland grassland habitats. The geographical location and moisture level of sites also influences community composition. A strong compositional difference exists between sites having duff vs. turf soil surface layers. Only 8% of sites were improperly classified when soil surface architecture was used as the sole predictor variable. Fully 43% of taxa exhibited significant preferences towards one of these surface types, while only 15% of relatively common (10 + occurrence) taxa showed no preferences. Twelve groups of closely related taxa within the same genus had members that favoured different surface types, indicating that differential selection pressures have existed over evolutionary time scales. While turf faunas appeared unaffected by anthropogenic disturbance, duff faunas were strongly impacted, suggesting that their conservation will require protection of soil surface architecture.","Nekola, J.C.","","9",2003,"Cluster analysis; Community ecology; Conservation biology; Landscape pattern; Multi-dimensional scaling; North America; Soil architecture; Terrestrial gastropods","","","","","","","","",""

Scenarios for the future were projected to better understand the consequences of climatic shifts on the species’ survival. Our results revealed that each subspecies is currently distributed in different bioregions and displays substantial geographic separation as a consequence of past climate oscillations. The projected future scenarios suggest that all subspecies would be affected by habitat fragmentation.

Several features of the social behavior and social systems of American bison are illuminated by this ecological-evolutionary perspective. The strong seasonality of breeding and birth appears adaptive to the seasonality of the environment, as does seasonality in the dimorphic hair displays of males. Low stability of group membership appears adaptive to the low patchiness and high cyclicism of food abundance. Flexibility in birth site selection and the determinants of dominance status among cows appears to be adaptive to the range of habitats occupied and to the fluctuations in carrying capacity associated with climatic cyclicism. The social system and ecological circumstances of the American bison probably produced an outbred species.

The purpose was to determine whether present-day grasslands are ecologically plausible Beringian relicts or analogues. The Beringian climate was represented by meteorological stations with average July temperatures 4˚C colder than those of present-day grassland areas; all were from Arctic locations. The most commonly occupied grassland slopes received maximum local solar radiation and likely represented the warmest topographic positions in the landscape. Their summer evapotranspiration demands exceeded the 200 mm moisture supply by 189 mm. The same slopes had late-Wisconsinan summer moisture balances of −57 to −101 mm because of colder and shorter growing seasons. Moisture balances for late-Wisconsinan SSW slopes were similar to those of present-day WNW–NW aspects, which do not support grasslands.

Humans are altering or completely eliminating these disturbance regimes at a global scale, with important consequences for savanna ecosystem structure and function. It is unknown whether the alteration of these disturbance regimes will have similar effects on grass communities of savanna grasslands in different geographic regions that vary in their biogeographic and evolutionary histories, as well as in the diversity of extant grazers. Here, we examined the effects of large herbivore loss on different aspects of grass community structure - taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional - across a range of fire frequencies in C<inf>4</inf>-dominated mesic savanna grassland sites of North America (Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas, USA) and South Africa (Kruger National Park). The goal of the study was to determine whether the loss of large herbivores exerted a consistent effect on the grass communities of two physiognomically similar grasslands with different biogeographic and grazing histories. The removal of large herbivores resulted in divergent responses in the grass communities at Konza and Kruger that was consistent across fire treatments. At Konza, there was a rapid and significant response to grazing exclusion while the response was muted and transient at Kruger. Functional syndromes associated with grazing resistance were generally conserved across sites, and it was the functional strategies of the dominant species at each site that drove the divergent responses. Further, our study supports the hypothesis that grazing and aridity may be selective forces that act in parallel as those species that were grazing resistant also occupied drier niches. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that savanna grassland communities with different biogeographic and grazing histories respond differently to the removal of large herbivores and that climate, fire and grazing are interactive forces in maintaining savanna grassland diversity and function. We show that the functional attributes of the dominant grasses, which are in part driven by the biogeographic and grazing history experienced, are the most relevant in predicting the response of savanna ecosystems to the loss of large herbivores. © 2015 The Authors.

Throughout this study, plants with elevated Se levels suffered less herbivory and survived better than plants with low leaf Se concentrations. This study indicates that the Se in hyperaccumulator S. pinnata protects the plant in its natural habitat from herbivory by the black-tailed prairie dog. The results from this study support the hypothesis that herbivory by prairie dogs or similar small mammals has been a contributing selection pressure for the evolution of plant Se hyperaccumulation in North America.

Management of rangelands has long operated under the paradigm of minimizing spatially discrete disturbances, often under the objective of reducing inherent heterogeneity within managed ecosystems. Management of grazing animals has focused on uniform distribution of disturbance, so that no areas are heavily disturbed or undisturbed (i.e. management to the 'middle'). 2. A model of the fire-grazing interaction argues that grazing and fire interact through a series of positive and negative feedbacks to cause a shifting mosaic of vegetation pattern across the landscape. This interaction was important in the evolution of species in the North American Great Plains grasslands. This approach has the potential to serve as an ecological-based model for management of grasslands with a long evolutionary history of grazing. 3. We compared a heterogeneity-based approach, in which fire is applied to discrete patches, with typical homogeneity-based land management in the North American Great Plains, to determine if patch burning followed by focal grazing creates a shifting mosaic pattern of vegetation structure and composition. 4. Our data suggest that spatially discrete fires promote focal grazing, where grazing animals devote 75% of grazing time within the one-third of the area that has been burned within the past year. These focal disturbances cause local changes in the plant community and increase patch-level heterogeneity across landscapes. As the focal disturbance is shifted to other patches over time, successional processes lead to changes in local plant communities and the patchwork landscape can be described as a shifting mosaic. 5. A patch-dynamic approach can be accomplished in the tallgrass prairie through applying spatially discrete fires and allowing animals free access to a diversity of landscape elements that vary in time since focal disturbance. This increases heterogeneity across the landscape, a variable that has been shown to be critical to some wildlife species as well as the structure and function of grassland ecosystems. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that the fire-grazing model may be useful for generating heterogeneity in grassland management. Discrete fires are applied to patches, and patchy grazing by herbivores promotes a shifting vegetation mosaic across the landscape. Furthermore, application of the model has the potential of increasing the area of rangelands under management for conservation purposes, because livestock production is maintained at a level similar to traditional management. So, by managing transient focal patches that move through the landscape, heterogeneity has the potential to be a central paradigm for managing landscapes for multiple objectives, such as biodiversity and agricultural productivity.","Engle, D.M.; Fuhlendorf, S.D.","","41",2004,"Conservation biology; Ecosystem management; Equilibrium; Heterogeneity; Invasive species; Landscape ecology; Patch dynamics; Rangeland","","","","","","","","",""

Using Australian and African climofunctions and models gives very different reconstructions of paleoclimate (subhumid versus perhumid) and paleovegetation (woodland versus rainforest) for North American fossil mammal faunas before Cenozoic evolution of grassland ecosystems. Modern mammal faunas of Africa and Australia have different ecological spectra of taxonomic units, body size, feeding, and locomotion of species of mammals on precipitation gradients. Gradients in proportions of such categories yield transfer functions for mean annual precipitation from percent species of Artiodactyla or Macropodidae, percent species of moderately large animals (45-180. kg), percent species of arboreal mammals, and percent species of grazers. These transfer functions can be applied to fossil mammal faunas to estimate paleoprecipitation in Africa, Australia and North America. Modern transfer functions match well paleoprecipitation estimates based on depth to calcic horizons in paleosols at the same localities in Kenya and inland Australia back through the Miocene. For fossil mammal faunas of the Rocky Mountain region of North America, African transfer functions fail, but Australian transfer functions predict paleoprecipitation back to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (66.

C 3 and C 4 grasses are typically represented in earth system models (ESMs) by different plant functional types (PFTs). The ability of ESMs to capture C 4 grass biogeography and ecology across differing time periods is important to assess, given the crucial role they play in ecosystems and their divergent responses to global change. Location: North America. Time periods: Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), historical modern period (ca. 1850) and end of this century. Major taxa studied: C 4 grasses. Methods: Proxy data representing relative cover and productivity of C 4 grasses were collated, including carbon isotope ratios of soil carbon and animal grazer tissue, and vegetation plot data in undisturbed grasslands. We selected available model predictions of C 4 PFT percentage cover. Models were compared against one another and assessed against proxy data at key time points: the LGM, the historical modern period before widespread grassland conversion to agriculture, and the end of this century. Results: We highlight large differences among model predictions of percentage C 4 grass cover across North America: all pairwise combinations have correlations &lt;.5, and most are &lt;.2. Models also do not capture spatial patterns of the percentage C 4 grass cover from proxy data, during either the LGM or the historical modern period. Models generally under-predict percentage C 4 grass cover, particularly during the historical modern period.

This is particularly true for historical fire regimes of the Americas, where indigenous groups used fire for myriad reasons but paleofire records indicate strong climate–fire relationships. In North American grasslands, decadal-scale wet periods facilitated widespread fire activity because of the abundance of fuel promoted by pluvial episodes. In these settings, human impacts on fire regimes are assumed to be independent of climate, thereby diminishing the strength of climate–fire relationships. We used an offsite geoarchaeological approach to link terrestrial records of prairie fire activity with spatially related archaeological features (driveline complexes) used for intensive, communal bison hunting in north-central Montana. Radiocarbon-dated charcoal layers from alluvial and colluvial deposits associated with driveline complexes indicate that peak fire activity over the past millennium occurred coincident with the use of these features (ca. 1100–1650 CE). However, comparison of dated fire deposits with Palmer Drought Severity Index reconstructions reveal strong climate–fire linkages. More than half of all charcoal layers coincide with modest pluvial episodes, suggesting that fire use by indigenous hunters enhanced the effects of climate variability on prairie fire regimes. These results indicate that relatively small, mobile human populations can impact natural fire regimes, even in pyrogeographic settings in which climate exerts strong, top-down controls on fuels. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

Here, we use modern tools to revisit a classic system of local adaptation in the North American deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, which occupies two main habitat types: prairie and forest. Using historical collections, we find that forest-dwelling mice have longer tails than those from nonforested habitat, even when we account for individual and population relatedness. Using genome-wide SNP data, we show that mice from forested habitats in the eastern and western parts of their range form separate clades, suggesting that increased tail length evolved independently. We find that forest mice in the east and west have both more and longer caudal vertebrae, but not trunk vertebrae, than nearby prairie forms. By intercrossing prairie and forest mice, we show that the number and length of caudal vertebrae are not correlated in this recombinant population, indicating that variation in these traits is controlled by separate genetic loci. Together, these results demonstrate convergent evolution of the long-tailed forest phenotype through two distinct genetic mechanisms, affecting number and length of vertebrae, and suggest that these morphological changes—either independently or together—are adaptive. © 2016 The Author(s).

The Madro-Tertiary Geoflora comprises semiarid live oak-conifer woodland, chaparral, arid subtropic scrub, plains (desert) grassland, and subdesert to desert vegetation. 2. The taxonomic and adaptive relations of its plants suggest that it was derived chiefly from subtropical to warm temperate groups that evolved in response to the expansion of a new adaptive zone-dry climate. 3. The geoflora seems to have had an origin in southwestern North America because (a) types that appear to be ancestral to Madro-Tertiary lineages are represented in the Cretaceous and Paleocene floras of that region, (b) they are not known from the temperate Arcto-Tertiary Geoflora to northward, and (c) they are not recorded in the humid phases of the Neotropical-Tertiary Geoflora. 4. Geologic and paleoclimatic data suggest that southwestern North America was generally a lowland region, characterized by tropic savanna climate during the Cretaceous and Early Tertiary. 5. During this interval, ancestral Madro-Tertiary phylads probably were evolving chiefly in sites away from the moist lowland floodplains, in drier areas provided by local edaphic and climatic conditions. 6. With a strong linear component to selection imposed by a gradual trend toward increased aridity, these scattered, isolated phylads of subtropic to warm temperate affinities may have been undergoing megaevolution during the Cretaceous and Paleocene, giving rise to numerous, highly specialized taxonomic and adaptive types. 7. When first recorded in moderate numbers in the Eocene and early Oligocene, they are closely similar to modern species. 8. As dry climates continued to expand in area and to increase in severity, the Madro-Tertiary Geoflora migrated widely over southwestern North America. The stage during which it attained dominance in each province was governed chiefly by geographic position and time. 9. In response to the evolution of new dry climates in the later Cenozoic, each of the generalized Madro-Tertiary communities was differentiated into a number of modern associations that are adapted now to more localized dry environments. © 1958 The New York Botanical Garden.","Axelrod, D.I.","","24",1958,"","","","","","","","","",""

Any discussion of an interaction between fire and grazing is usually based on a statistical approach that ignores the spatial and temporal interactions on complex landscapes. We propose a new focus on the ecological interaction of fire and grazing in which each disturbance is spatially and temporally dependent on the other and results in a landscape where disturbance is best described as a shifting mosaic (a landscape with patches that vary with time since disturbance) that is critical to ecological structure and function of many ecosystems. We call this spatiotemporal interaction pyric herbivory (literal interpretation means grazing driven by fire). Pyric herbivory is the spatial and temporal interaction of fire and grazing, where positive and negative feedbacks promote a shifting pattern of disturbance across the landscape. We present data we collected from the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in the southern Great Plains of North America that demonstrates that the interaction between free-roaming bison (Bison bison) and random fires promotes heterogeneity and provides the foundation for biological diversity and ecosystem function of North American and African grasslands. This study is different from other studies of fire and grazing because the fires we examined were random and grazing animals were free to roam and select from burned and unburned patches. For ecosystems across the globe with a long history of fire and grazing, pyric herbivory with any grazing herbivore is likely more effective at restoring evolutionary disturbance patterns than a focus on restoring any large vertebrate while ignoring the interaction with fire and other disturbances. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.","Engle, D.M.; Fuhlendorf, S.D.; Hamilton, R.; Kerby, J.","","23",2009,"Biodiversity; Bison; Disturbance ecology; Fire; Grasslands; Grazing; Herbivory; Heterogeneity","","","","","","","","",""

The lowest portion of the Greenhorn Limestone, the base of the Lincoln Limestone Member, contains calcarenite beds rich in disarticulated remains of marine vertebrates. We examined the composition of the vertebrate paleofauna from one particular location (Tobe locality) through surface collecting and acid solution of rocks. The paleofauna is taxonomically diverse, consisting of 22 chondrichthyans, at least 15 osteichthyan fishes, and six aquatic reptiles. Molluscan taxa indicate that the basal Lincoln Limestone in southeastern Colorado was deposited sometime between middle Middle Cenomanian (ca. 95 Ma) and late Middle Cenomanian (ca. 94.7 Ma), and the composition of the vertebrate fauna (primarily chondrichthyan taxa) agrees with this interpretation. The Tobe locality was situated far from the shorelines of the Western Interior Seaway, with relatively high-energy waves impinging upon the seafloor, concentrating biogenic remains. Fossil remains within the calcarenite appear to have undergone minor time-averaging, based upon erosional rounding and breakage present in numerous specimens. Nevertheless, the deposit contains one of the best representative Middle Cenomanian vertebrate communities so far described from the Western Interior Seaway of North America.

Species survived these glacial cycles south of the ice sheets and/or in other refugia, such as Beringia. In this study, we assessed, using mitochondrial DNA from three Diptera species, whether flies currently found in Beringian grasslands (1) survived glaciation as disjunct populations in Beringia and in the southern refugium; (2) dispersed northward postglacially from the southern refugium; or (3) arose by a combination of the two. Samples were collected in grasslands in western Canada: Prairies in Alberta and Manitoba; the Peace River region (Alberta); and the southern Yukon Territory. We sequenced two gene regions (658 bp of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 510 bp of cytochrome b) from three species of higher Diptera: one with a continuous distribution across grassland regions, and two with disjunct populations between the regions. We used a Bayesian approach to determine population groupings without a priori assumptions and performed analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and exact tests of population differentiation (ETPD) to examine their validity. Molecular dating was used to establish divergence times. Results: Two geographically structured populations were found for all species: a southern Prairie and Peace River population, and a Yukon population. Although AMOVA did not show significant differentiation between populations, ETPD did. Divergence time between Yukon and southern populations predated the Holocene for two species; the species with an ambiguous divergence time had high haplotype diversity, which could suggest survival in a Beringian refugium. Conclusions: Populations of Diptera in Yukon grasslands could have persisted in steppe habitats in Beringia through Pleistocene glaciations. Current populations in the region appear to be a mix of Beringian relict populations and, to a lesser extent, postglacial dispersal northward from southern prairie grasslands. © 2019 The Author(s).","Buddle, C.M.; Skevington, J.H.; Solecki, A.M.; Wheeler, T.A.","","19",2019,"Beringia; COI; Chloropidae; Cyt b; Heleomyzidae; Holocene; Nearctic; Pleistocene; Refugium","","","","","","","","",""

The uppermost sediments of this vast region are aeolian deposits, formed by aeolian deposition into grassland vegetation. Grass cover enhances aeolian deposition by slowing near-surface winds and vegetation secures sediments once they are deposited. The benefits of grass cover, however, are lost when occasional fires remove protective vegetation from fields. After a fire, the underlying soil surface becomes exposed and susceptible to wind erosion until the vegetative cover is re-established. The purpose of this study was to explore the post-fire recovery process by monitoring temporal variations in aeolian transport and changes in the threshold velocity of a burned grass field located in Lubbock County, Texas. A continuous record of wind erosion activity was obtained during a six-month period as the surface recovered from a highly erodible state to a more vegetated and stable surface. Results suggest that the threshold wind speed of the field increased from less than 10 m/s immediately following the fire to above 19 m/s in a three-month period as vegetation naturally recovered. © 2012.","Stout, J.E.","","82",2012,"Aeolian; Blown sand; Grassland; Saltation; Wildfire","","","","","","","","",""

Although this species is relatively common in fossil localities of the United States and Mexico, much remains to be known regarding its feeding ecology. We applied a multidisciplinary approach to reconstruct the dietary behavior of A. stockii based on a sample from Arroyo La Carreta locality, latest Hemphillian of Guanajuato, central Mexico. Carbon isotope and meso- and microwear analyses were conducted. The δ13C isotope data indicate a diet consisting of both C3/C4 plants with a preference for C4 plants (average δ13C of -1.9‰ ± 1.3‰ [SD]), whereas the micro-(high number of scratches and a low number of pits) and mesowear (round to blunt cusps and low relief) signatures implied processing of abrasive sources (biogenic and abiogenic). The information about the feeding ecology of A. stockii from Guanajuato, Chihuahua, Florida and Texas showed that this North American horse had broad feeding habits, ranging from almost exclusive grazing to browsing. The dietary flexibility in this horse species is probably related to local environmental conditions, suggesting an adaptable dietary regime across its geographic distribution.

Evidence from δ13C of palaeosol organic carbon","δ13C values of organic carbon in palaeosols integrate and record the relative contributions of C3 (δ13C κ -13‰) to net primary productivity of past plant communities. Because the geographical distribution and relative productivity of C4 species are both correlated strongly and positively with temperature, δ13C values of palaeosol organic carbon should reflect long term vegetation dynamics and past climate variations. To improve the understanding of vegetation-climate dynamics in the North American Great Plains during the late Quaternary, δ13C of organic carbon is stacked, 14C dated palaeosol sequences in the southern and northern portions of this region have been determined. The presence of a significant C4 grass component throughout the late Quaternary at both sites indicates that both were grasslands or open savannahs during this entire period. In the southern Great Plains, variations in δ13C and relative C4 productivity between 15 000 and 9000 a BP were well correlated with climatic variation induced by glacial meltwater in the Gulf of Mexico. The relative productivity of C4 plants was greatest during the Holocene at approximately 5000 and 2000 a BP. In the northern Great Plains, δ13C and relative C4 approximately 5000 and 2000 a BP. In the northern Great Plains, δ13C and relative C4 productivity were lowest during the late Pleistocene-early Holocene, indicating cool conditions at that time. δ13C and relative C4 productivity increased rapidly after 11 000 a BP to a maxima at 7000-2000 a BP, suggesting warm conditions then. These late Quaternary δ13C records of relative C4 productivity are strongly correlated with previous climatic inferences for these regions based on other methods, suggesting that δ13C of palaeosol organic carbon may be a useful proxy for palaeotemperature in the Great Plains and perhaps in other grassland or savannah regions. Furthermore, these large shifts in the relative productivities of C3 and C4 plants (which differ in carbon, nutrient and water use characteristics) in the Great Plains during the late Quaternary may have implications for modelling climate and biogeochemical cycles at regional and global scales during this time.","Boutton, T.W.; Kuehn, D.D.; Nordt, L.C.","","",1998,"","","","","","","","","",""

Here we explore the evolutionary history of yellow warbler lineages, focusing on how these lineages recolonized their current range. We genotyped samples from 696 yellow warblers via direct sequencing of a 333-bp control region I mitochondrial DNA fragment or lineage-specific genotyping. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two monophyletic clades: a highly migratory group including previously identified eastern and western lineages and a less migratory group including a lineage consisting of tropical residents and a new 'southern' lineage localized in southwest United States. We then modelled the expansion of the eastern and western lineages, identified the location of potential refugia and assessed the importance of migration as a historical factor promoting gene flow. The expansion of the eastern lineage proceeded from a main refugia in the eastern United States, with possible contribution of an additional local refugia. In the western lineage, the expansion proceeded from a single refugia possibly located in western United States. Because two lineages overlapped to varying degrees in central North America, we suggest that the Canadian Prairies offered a bridge of riparian habitats where the lineages met after glacier retreat, while the US Central Great Plains acted as a barrier that limited secondary contact.

The region represents a topographically complex landscape with a Neogene history of dramatic geological and climatic transformations. Phylogenetic and dating analyses of mitochondrial DNA support an initial split among 4 major lineages during the late Miocene, and this hypothesis receives further support from analysis of a portion of the nuclear interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) gene. Two of these lineages have a restricted geographic distribution in the Chihuahuan Desert, and 2 have distributions ranging across large portions of the Chihuahuan Desert, Colorado Plateau, Great Plains, and Tamaulipan Plain. Within the 2 widespread lineages further geographical diversification likely was concentrated in the Pliocene, which coincided with the origin of several hypothesized geographic barriers. These results are consistent with models of allopatric divergence driven by pre-Pleistocene geological and climatic events, particularly the late-Miocene expansion of interior grasslands and MiocenePliocene evolution of Basin and Range geomorphology.

Vegetation on ultramafic soils takes the form of distinctive variants of conifer or mixed conifer-hardwood forest, chaparral, or grassland. Three types of floristic elements can be found: 1) serpentine enedemics, 2) local or regional indicator species, and 3) bodenvag species, widespread taxa. The greatest concentration of species endemic to serpentine is in the Klamath-Siskiyou mountain complex of NW California and SW Oregon, with secondary concentrations in the North Coast and South Coast ranges and the Sierra Nevada of California. The evolution of a serpentine flora may involve a variety of speciation routes. The most probable sequence for diploid taxa could involve: 1) genetic preadaptation to serpentine within a non-serpentine species: 2) racial fixation of the preadapted genotype; 3) further morphological and physiological divergence yielding an infraspecific variant; 4) attaining species status by further genetic and ecological isolation. This sequence is illustrated by Streptanthus, a genus of western North American crucifers, with varying degrees of fidelity and narrow endemism. A more rapid mode of speciation on serpentine, saltational speciation by catastrophic selection, has been proposed. Adaptation to ultramafic soils is likely to involve both physiological and morphological modifications.

Paleoenvironmental reconstructions coupled with mammalian fossil assemblages from the Crowder and Cajon Valley formations in the Mojave Desert, California, contribute insights into local-scale (10s of kilometers) responses to warming during the Hemingfordian and Barstovian North American Land Mammal Ages. By integrating lithological descriptions, phytolith analyses, carbon isotope composition of preserved soil organic matter (δ13CSOM), and elemental geochemistry of paleosols, we provide reconstructions of depositional environments, vegetation, and precipitation through the MCO. Phytolith and δ13CSOM evidence suggest that paleoenvironments were predominately C3 grasslands, with the earliest potential presence of C4 grasses in the region found within the Crowder Formation at ~17 Ma. Based on elemental geochemistry of paleosols, mean annual precipitation estimates are 807 (±182) mm yr− 1 at 17 Ma in the Crowder Formation and 740–800 (±182) mm yr− 1 from 16 to 15 Ma in the Cajon Valley Formation. Our multiproxy approach indicates that the Crowder and Cajon Valley basins were stable, large-scale braided stream and floodplain systems with intermittent paleosol development and heterogeneity in vegetation and moisture conditions across spatial scales. Overall, we find a signal of local paleoenvironmental stability during the MCO; however, a significant drying trend in the Crowder Formation does correspond with faunal turnover and reduction in the number of taxa present. High species diversity within faunal assemblages, especially among small mammals, and fewer shared species between the Crowder and Cajon Valley assemblages than expected based on bootstrap analysis indicate that peak mammal diversity was accommodated at both local and regional scales during sustained tectonic activity and the MCO in western North America. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cotton, J.M.; Hyland, E.G.; Reynolds, R.E.; Smiley, T.M.","","490",2018,"Cajon Valley Formation; Crowder Formation; Mammal diversity; Paleoprecipitation; Phytolith assemblages; Stable isotopes","","","","","","","","",""

Muhlenbergiinae, the largest subtribe of C4 grasses in Mexico and the southwestern United States (with 176 species), is taxonomically poorly understood. Methods: We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 47 genera and 174 species using six plastid regions (ndhA intron, ndhF, rps16-trnK, rps16 intron, rps3, and rpl32-trnL) and the nuclear ITS 1 and 2 (ribosomal internal transcribed spacer) regions to infer evolutionary relationships and revise the classification. Key results: In our analyses, Muhlenbergia (ca. 153 species) is paraphyletic, with nine genera (Aegopogon, Bealia, Blepharoneuron, Chaboissaea, Lycurus, Muhlenbergia, Pereilema, Redfieldia, Schaffnerella, and Schedonnardus) found nested within. We recognized the following five well-supported monophyletic lineages within Muhlenbergia: subg. Muhlenbergia, with species that have phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-like leaf anatomy and long, scaly rhizomes; subg. Trichochloa with long-lived species that are relatively tall (up to 3 m); subg. Clomena with 3-nerved upper glumes; sect. Pseudosporobolus species with narrow panicles and plumbeous spikelets; and sect. Bealia species with lemmas with hairy margins and midveins. Conclusions: We propose expanding the circumscription of Muhlenbergia to include the other nine genera in this subtribe and make the following new combinations: Muhlenbergia subg. Bealia, M. diandra, M. geminiflora, M. paniculata, M. phleoides, M. subg. Pseudosporobolus (also lectotipified), M. solisii, M. tricholepis. We also propose several new names: M. ammophila, M. columbi, M. plumosa.

We measured key root and leaf traits of grasses from 77 sites in four grassland regions of the world (New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, North America). Within each region, the relationships among leaf traits paralleled those among root traits. Plants with low root or leaf N concentrations had roots or leaves with high tissue density, high lignin concentrations, low amount of mass that was soluble in a neutral detergent solution, large diameter/thickness, and were less enriched in 15N. Yet, whether comparing plants within a region or among all four regions, there was little relationship between root traits and leaf traits, except for a positive relationship between root and leaf N concentration and between root and leaf δ15N. At the global scale, factors such as soil freezing and the type of nutrient limitation appear to determine relationships among leaves and roots. C4 grasses not only had lower leaf N concentrations than C3 grasses but also lower root N concentrations. When compared at the same root N concentration, C4 grasses had greater leaf N concentrations than C3 grasses.","Bond, W.J.; Craine, J.M.; Johnson, L.C.; Lee, W.G.; Williams, R.J.","","86",2005,"Grass; Leaf; Nitrogen cycling; Plant functional traits; Root","","","","","","","","",""

The geochemical fingerprint for each drainage basin was determined from the elemental composition of heavy minerals in the silt-sized fraction of modern sediment samples. Down-core elemental abundances were compared with these fingerprints by use of a chemical-mass-balance model that apportions sediment to the source areas. We observed a decreased contribution from the Minnesota River during the interval ∼6700-5500 14C yr BP, which we attribute to decreased discharge of the Minnesota River, likely controlled by a combination of precipitation, snow melt, and groundwater input to the river. This hydrologic condition coincides with the mid-Holocene prairie period recorded by fossil pollen data.

Many more recent studies, however, have reported asynchrony in the origin of hypsodonty and the widespread appearance of grasslands and have considered exposure to exogenous grit as important evolutionary drivers of hypsodonty in ungulates. We tracked changes in crown height (hypsodonty index), relative abrasion (mesowear), and food and grit scar topography on dental enamel (microwear) to examine the relative contributions of grass vs. grit as a driving force in ungulate tooth changes during the evolution of North American Equidae compared to four North American ruminant artiodactyl families (Camelidae, Antilocapridae, Dromomerycidae, and Merycoidodontidae). We mirror other studies by finding that the overall pattern of the timing of the attainment of hypsodonty is inconsistent with grazing as the main impetus for the ""Great Transition"" within equids nor within the artiodactyl families as highly hypsodont ungulates post-date the spread of widespread grasslands. Mesowear closely mirrored hypsodonty trends in all families. Microwear patterns, particularly high degrees of enamel pitting (particularly large pits) and unusually coarse scratch textures in all five families, are consistent with exposure to exogenous grit as the main driver of hypsodonty acquisition prior to the consumption of significant levels of grass. Equidae exhibited a wider array of dietary behavior than the other families through most of their evolutionary history. Even so, grass was a much more common dietary item for equids than for the other families, and when combined with exogenous grit, which was more accelerated from the early Miocene onward based on more pitting and coarser scratch textures, may explain the more extreme acquisition of hypsodonty in equids compared to the artiodactyl families studied and set the stage for the Equidae alone to become hypergrazers in the Recent. © 2019 Semprebon, Rivals and Janis.","Janis, C.M.; Rivals, F.; Semprebon, G.M.","","7",2019,"Hypsodonty; Mesowear; Microwear; Paleodiet; Ungulates","","","","","","","","",""

In Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, USA, and in Mexico, desert grasslands have been invaded by dozens of non-native plants, especially perennial grasses that evolved in arid systems with similar climate and disturbance regimes. In desert grasslands invaded by non-native plants, biomass, richness, and diversity of native plants typically decrease, whereas plant density, biomass, and litter typically increase. These changes in composition and structure of the plant community affect animals that inhabit grassland ecosystems, with the direction and magnitude of effects reflecting the resource needs of each species, the degree of plant invasion, and the contrast in structure between invading and native plants. When non-native plants present similar structural cues but provide different levels of resources than native plants, cues that trigger habitat selection by animals may be decoupled from the resources linked evolutionarily to that cue, creating the potential for an ecological trap. Plant invasions also influence the ecological drivers that maintain grasslands in an open condition, which will alter the long-term dynamics of plant and animal populations. Specifically, by increasing fuel load and continuity, fires in invaded grasslands increase in frequency and intensity relative to those in native grasslands. Although eradication is unlikely once a non-native plant has naturalized, retaining patches of native vegetation within a matrix of non-native plants may provide a strategy to reduce effects of plant invasions on wildlife in grasslands. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","Litt, A.R.; Matter, W.J.; Steidl, R.J.","","37",2013,"Desert grasslands; Exotic species; Grasslands; Non-native species; Semi-desert grasslands; Species invasions","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, the amount of temporal and spatial variability exhibited among grassland pollen assemblages, and the influence of these biotic and abiotic drivers on pollen assemblage composition and diversity has been relatively understudied. Here, we examine 4 years of modern pollen assemblages collected from a series of 28 traps at the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research Area in the Flint Hills of Kansas, with the aim of evaluating the influence of these drivers, as well as quantifying the amount of spatial and temporal variability in the pollen signatures of the tallgrass prairie biome. We include all terrestrial pollen taxa in our analyses while calculating four summative metrics of pollen diversity and composition – beta-diversity, Shannon index, nonarboreal pollen percentage, and Ambrosia:Artemisia – and find different roles of fire, herbivory, and topography variables in relation to these pollen metrics. In addition, we find significant annual differences in the means of three of these metrics, particularly the year 2013 which experienced high precipitation relative to the other 3 years of data. To quantify spatial and temporal dissimilarity among the samples over the 4-year study, we calculate pairwise squared-chord distances (SCD). The SCD values indicate higher compositional dissimilarity across the traps (0.38 mean) among all years than within a single trap from year to year (0.31 mean), suggesting that grassland vegetation can have different pollen signatures across finely sampled space and time, and emphasizing the need for additional long-term annual monitoring of grassland pollen. © 2016 The Authors.

To evaluate the predictive power of the models, we compared their estimates against observed data.

In particular, the identification of ancient forests and past climate regimes will better our understanding of the environmental context of mammalian evolution during the late Cenozoic. Stable isotope analyses of bulk and serial samples of fossil tooth enamel from all ungulates present at the Gray site elucidate paleoecological reconstructions. The herbivorous megafauna include taxa of likely North American and Eurasian ancestry including: the tapir Tapirus polkensis, rhino Teleoceras cf. T. hicksi, camel cf. Megatylopus sp., peccary Tayassuidae, and proboscidean Gomphotheriidae. The tapir, rhino, camel, and peccary yield mean stable carbon isotope (δ13C) tooth enamel values of - 13.0‰, - 13.3‰, - 13.8‰, and - 13.1‰, respectively, suggesting forest-dwelling browsers. This range of δ13C values indicates the presence of a C3 dominated ancient local flora. Because δ13C values decline with increasing canopy density, the ancient temperate forests from the Gray site were moderately dense. The lack of significant C4 plant consumption (i.e., tooth enamel δ13C values &lt; - 9‰) suggests the presence of forests large enough to independently support the continued browsing of sustainable populations of browsers from the Gray site. In contrast, bulk and serial δ13C values ranging from - 0.7‰ to 0.3‰ from a gomphothere tusk support a diet consisting of C4 grasses, suggesting the presence of C4 grasslands within the individuals home range. The rare earth element (REE) analyses of the gomphothere tusk and the teeth of Tapirus and Teleoceras indicates that these individuals shared similar depositional environments; thus, demonstrating the concurrent presence of C3 forests and C4 grasslands in the northeast. Stable carbon and oxygen serial sample variation of the tapir, rhino, peccary, and gomphothere is less than 1.5‰, suggesting minor differences in seasonal temperature and/or precipitation.

Specific fruit types aid different mechanisms of seed dispersal.

To address these questions, we first surveyed the orders and families of angiosperms for fruit types and found no clear association between fruit types and major angiosperm lineages, suggesting there was little phylogenetic constraint on fruit evolution at this level. We then surveyed fruit types found in two contrasting habitats: an open habitat including the Indian desert and North American plains and prairies, and a closed forest habitat of Australian tropical forest. The majority of genera in the survey of tropical forests in Australia were fleshy fruit trees, whereas the majority of genera in the survey of prairies and plains in central North America were herbs with capsules and achenes. Both capsules and achenes are frequently dispersed by wind in the open, arid habitat, whereas fleshy fruits are generally dispersed by animals. Since desert and plains tend to provide continuous wind to aid dispersal and there are more abundant mammal and bird dispersers in the closed forest, this survey suggests that fruit evolution was driven at least in part by dispersal agents abundant in particular habitats.","Briggeman, T.; Lorts, C.M.; Sang, T.","","46",2008,"Adaptation; Angiosperm; Animal dispersal; Fruit development; Wind dispersal","","","","","","","","",""

We used complete mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences to construct a phylogeny that includes all 43 currently recognized species in the two genera, as well as representatives of two closely related genera (Marmota and Ammospermophilus). In addition, divergence times for ground squirrel lineages were estimated using Bayesian techniques that do not assume a molecular clock. All methods of phylogenetic analysis recovered the same major clades, and showed the genus Spermophilus to be paraphyletic with respect to both Marmota and Cynomys. Not only is the phylogeny at odds with previous hypotheses of ground squirrel relationships, but it suggests that convergence in morphology has been a common theme in ground squirrel evolution. A well-supported basal clade, including Ammospermophilus and two species in the subgenus Otospermophilus, diverged from all other ground squirrels an estimated 17.5 million years ago. Between 10 and 14 million years ago, a relatively rapid diversification gave rise to lineages leading to marmots and to several distinct groups of ground squirrels. The Eurasian ground squirrels diverged from their North American relatives during this period, far earlier than previously hypothesized. This period of diversification corresponded to warming climate and spread of grasslands in western North America and Eurasia.

Few observed hydroclimatic records from this region exceed in length the ~60-year periodicity of the lower frequency climate oscillations; however, tree-ring proxy data from semi-arid western North America document natural hydroclimate variation over centennial to millennial scales. We reconstructed the summer Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) over the western Canadian Prairies, providing a record of drought for the past 600 years. This long reconstruction was examined for information about the severity, intensity, and duration of positive (wet) and negative (dry) summer moisture anomalies during the different phases of the PDO and the ENSO, as reconstructed by other researchers from independent proxy datasets. As well, by comparing our PDSI reconstruction to other researchers' independent regional summer temperature reconstruction, we were able to identify warm versus cold droughts, and warm versus cold wet periods. The reconstruction was also compared to 500hPa geopotential heights. These results suggest that summer moisture conditions are associated with the North Pacific Ocean and tropical Pacific Ocean variability. Summer droughts generally have occurred during the positive PDO phase; however, ENSO conditions have varied between El Niño and La Niña. The most severe droughts, such as those of AD 1858-1872 and AD 1930-1941, were commonly associated with higher summer temperatures, the positive phase of the PDO, and increased ENSO variability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Lapp, S.L.; Sauchyn, D.J.; St. Jacques, J.-M.; Vanstone, J.R.","","310",2013,"","","","","","","","","",""

Frans Vera's recent hypothesis that large mammals created mosaics of forest and openland vegetation in both regions throughout the Holocene has been particularly controversial and has provoked new approaches to conservation management. Thirty years earlier, American paleoecologists Herb Wright and Margaret Davis debated whether abundant ragweed pollen at Rogers Lake, Connecticut at 9500 yr BP signified local forest openings or long-distance transport of pollen from Midwestern prairies. Using new pollen records from Harvard Forest and the North American Pollen Database, we address this question and offer insights to the openland discussion. Ragweed and other forbs exceed 3.5% at five sites in a restricted area of southern New England between 10 100 and 7700 yr BP. Strong evidence suggests this pollen originated from the landscapes surrounding these sites (supporting Davis), as ragweed pollen percentages do not increase with longitude from New England to the Midwest. Ragweed pollen percentages are also unrelated to basin size and therefore unrelated to the proportion of extraregional pollen in New England. High forbs values were associated with increases in oak, decreases in white pine, and relatively high charcoal values. Modern pollen records with similar forb and tree percentages occur along the Prairie Peninsula region of the Upper Midwest. However, the closest analogue to the southern New England early Holocene assemblages comes from Massachusetts' Walden Pond in the early 18th century. These results and the affiliation of ragweed for open, disturbed habitats suggest that oak-pine forests with large openings persisted for over 2000 years due to dry conditions and perhaps increased fire frequency. This conclusion is corroborated by independent lake level and climate reconstructions. Because these early Holocene openlands have no detectable analogue in New England for the past 7000 years before European settlement, we suggest that all important openlands today are almost exclusively a legacy of Colonial agriculture and should be managed accordingly. Nonetheless, our results may have implications for forest dynamics accompanying projected climate change to more arid conditions in New England over the next century. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Doughty, E.; Faison, E.K.; Foster, D.R.; Hansen, B.C.S.; Oswald, W.W.","","87",2006,"Ambrosia spp.; Climate; Early Holocene; Fire; Forbs; Herbivores; Midwest; New England; Oak; Openlands; Paleoecology; Ragweed","","","","","","","","",""

At the western range margin of D. torquatus, these changes were characterized by a series of local extinctions and recolonizations. However, it is unclear whether this pattern represents a local phenomenon, possibly driven by ecological edge effects, or a global phenomenon that took place across large geographical scales. To address this, we explored the palaeogenetic history of the collared lemming using a next-generation sequencing approach for pooled mitochondrial DNA amplicons. Sequences were obtained from over 300 fossil remains sampled across Eurasia and two sites in North America. We identified five mitochondrial lineages of D. torquatus that succeeded each other through time across Europe and western Russia, indicating a history of repeated population extinctions and recolonizations, most likely from eastern Russia, during the last 50 000 years. The observation of repeated extinctions across such a vast geographical range indicates large-scale changes in the steppe-tundra environment in western Eurasia during the last glaciation. All Holocene samples, from across the species' entire range, belonged to only one of the five mitochondrial lineages. Thus, extant D. torquatus populations only harbour a small fraction of the total genetic diversity that existed across different stages of the Late Pleistocene. In North American samples, haplotypes belonging to both D. groenlandicus and D. richardsoni were recovered from a Late Pleistocene site in south-western Canada. This suggests that D. groenlandicus had a more southern and D. richardsoni a more northern glacial distribution than previously thought. This study provides significant insights into the population dynamics of a small mammal at a large geographical scale and reveals a rather complex demographical history, which could have had bottom-up effects in the Late Pleistocene steppe-tundra ecosystem. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Abramson, N.I.; Baca, M.; Dalén, L.; Douka, A.; Ersmark, E.; Fadeeva, T.; Germonpré, M.; Grigoriev, S.; Higham, T.F.G.; Jass, C.N.; Kalthoff, D.C.; Kosintsev, P.; Litvinov, Y.N.; Nadachowski, A.; Nikolskiy, P.; Nyström, J.; Palkopoulou, E.; Pavlova, E.; Pitulko, V.; Ponomarev, D.; Prost, S.; Sablin, M.; Smirnov, N.G.; Socha, P.; Stankovic, A.; Stewart, J.R.; Vartanyan, S.; Weogonekgleński, P.","","22",2016,"Biostratigraphy; Climate; Collared lemming; Genetic replacement; Palaeogenetics; Refugia","","","","","","","","",""

The site was favorably located from an environmental standpoint, being proximal to a diversity of microhabitats including expanses of open water and marshes from which the essential, renewable fish protein could be procured. More importantly, the largest local zone of soils characterized as optimal for prehistoric hoe cultivation lay immediately to the east. Here, on the floodplain and along its bordering alluvial fans, the large maize outfields were situated, while the multi-crop house gardens were placed within the habitation zone on soils that had often been culturally enriched by prior occupation. As successful as this strategy might have been for small, dispersed populations in such a plentiful environment, nucleation of large numbers of people at Cahokia provided a different adaptive context that ultimately led to ruinous consequences. The seeds for the city's destruction centered anthropogenically produced environmental degradation. Demands on wood resources for fuel and construction were enormous and agricultural field clearance was in forested rather than prairie settings. The resultant watershed deforestation produced greatly increased rates of erosion, runoff, and unseasonable downstream flooding during the summer growing season.

Root traces in these paleosols include both stout, tapering tubes, like roots of trees, as well as sinuous filamentous tubes, similar to roots of grasses. Paleosol structure is fine subangular blocky, with patchy distribution of grass-like roots, as in wooded grassland and sagebrush steppe with bunch grasses. Cursoriality in horses (Mesohippus, Miohippus) and hypsodonty in rhinos (Diceratherium) is also evidence for open grassy vegetation. Trace fossils of Pallichnus (dung beetle boli) and Edaphichnium (earthworm chimneys) are characteristic of wooded grassland paleosols, whereas Taenidium (cicada burrows) dominates desert shrubland paleosols, as has also been found in Quaternary paleosols and soils of eastern Washington. In both Oligocene and Quaternary paleosol sequences, arid shrubland and semiarid grassland paleosols alternate on Milankovitch frequencies (23, 41, 100 ka). The oldest known paleosols in Oregon with crumb structure and abundant fine fossil root traces characteristic of sod grasslands are dated by mammalian biostratigraphy as Hemingfordian (early Miocene, ca. 19 Ma). Wooded grassland habitats are indicated by scattered chalcedony-calcite rhizoconcretions from large woody plants, and by fossil chalicotheres (Moropus), camels (Gentilicamelus, ""Paratylopus"") and horses (Parahippus). Silty texture and silcrete horizons are evidence of semiarid to arid paleoclimate, and are in striking contrast to highly calcareous, and clayey underlying paleosols of the John Day Formation. These silcrete paleosols may represent the Miocene onset of summer-dry (Mediterranean) seasonality, as opposed to a summer-wet (monsoonal) pattern of seasonality found in this region during the Oligocene. Oregon's early rangelands can be compared with those in the North American Great Plains. Granular-structured calcareous paleosols of the Brule Formation of South Dakota are evidence of dry, bunch grasslands as old as 33 Ma (early Orellan, early Oligocene), and crumb-structured paleosols of the Anderson Ranch Formation of Nebraska are evidence of sod grasslands as old as 19 Ma (late Arikareean, early Miocene).

We present a high-resolution record from northwest Argentina in which the δ13C values of soil carbonate rise above a threshold of -8‰, suggesting the presence of C4 plants, starting at 7.3-6.7 Ma. δ13C values of fossil teeth from well dated sections in South and North America display a concomitant increase of C4 plants in the diets of large herbivores. These results show that the late Miocene expansion of C4 plants was global, but occurred at different rates in each region. While it is has been suggested that declining pCO2 levels during the late Neogene caused C4 plant expansion, climate change, such as an increase in summer-dominated rainfall regimes globally, is an alternative explanation. The δ18O soil carbonate records from South Asia, East Africa and now also northwest Argentina all show an increase of at least 3-4‰ in the late Neogene, either the result of climate change or of greater evaporation in average grassland soils.","Latorre, C.; McIntosh, W.C.; Quade, J.","","146",1997,"C-13/C-12; Miocene; Paleoclimatology; Paleosols; Teeth; Vegetation","","","","","","","","",""

Palynological results are complemented with pollen-based quantitative climate reconstructions. Our results indicate that the hinterland vegetation of the New Jersey shelf was characterized by oak-hickory forests in the lowlands and conifer-dominated vegetation in the highlands from the early Oligocene to the middle Miocene. The Oligocene witnessed several expansions of conifer forest, probably related to cooling events. The pollen-based climate data imply an increase in annual temperatures from ∼11.5 °C to more than 16 °C during the Oligocene. The Mi-1 cooling event at the onset of the Miocene is reflected by an expansion of conifers and mean annual temperature decrease of ∼4 °C, from ∼16 °C to ∼12 °C around 23 million years before present. Relatively low annual temperatures are also recorded for several samples during an interval around ∼20 million years before present, which may reflect the Mi-1a and the Mi-1aa cooling events. Generally, the Miocene ecosystem and climate conditions were very similar to those of the Oligocene. Miocene grasslands, as known from other areas in the USA during that time period, are not evident for the hinterland of the New Jersey shelf, possibly reflecting moisture from the proto-Gulf Stream. The palaeovegetation data reveal stable conditions during the mid-Miocene climatic optimum at ∼15 million years before present, with only a minor increase in deciduous-evergreen mixed forest taxa and a decrease in swamp forest taxa. Pollen-based annual temperature reconstructions show average annual temperatures of ∼14 °C during the mid-Miocene climatic optimum, ∼2 °C higher than today, but ∼1.5 °C lower than preceding and following phases of the Miocene. We conclude that vegetation and regional climate in the hinterland of the New Jersey shelf did not react as sensitively to Oligocene and Miocene climate changes as other regions in North America or Europe due to the moderating effects of the North Atlantic. An additional explanation for the relatively low regional temperatures reconstructed for the mid-Miocene climatic optimum could be an uplift of the Appalachian Mountains during the Miocene, which would also have influenced the catchment area of our pollen record. © Author(s) 2014.","Greenwood, D.R.; Hesselbo, S.P.; Kotthoff, U.; McCarthy, F.M.G.; Müller-Navarra, K.; Prader, S.","","10",2014,"","","","","","","","","",""

The capacity for large-scale movement (migration and/or nomadism) enables many species, from bison to lark buntings, to track pulses of productivity at broad spatial scales (&gt; 1 000 km2). Furthermore, even sedentary species often rely on metapopulation dynamics over extensive landscapes for long-term population viability. The current complex pattern of land ownership and use of Great Plains grasslands challenges native species conservation. Approaches to managing both public and private grasslands, frequently focused at the scale of individual pastures or ranches, limit opportunities to conserve landscape-scale processes such as fire, animal movement, and metapopulation dynamics. Using the US National Land Cover Database and Cropland Data Layers for 2011−2017, we analyzed land cover patterns for 12 historical grassland and savanna communities (regions) within the US Great Plains. On the basis of the results of these analyses, we highlight the critical contribution of restored grasslands to the future conservation of Great Plains biodiversity, such as those enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program. Managing disturbance regimes at larger spatial scales will require acknowledging that, where native large herbivores are absent, domestic livestock grazing can function as a central component of Great Plains disturbance regimes if they are able move at large spatial scales and coexist with a diverse array of native flora and fauna. Opportunities to increase the scale of grassland management include 1) spatial prioritization of grassland restoration and reintroduction of grazing and fire, 2) finding creative approaches to increase the spatial scale at which fire and grazing can be applied to address watershed to landscape-scale objectives, and 3) developing partnerships among government agencies, landowners, businesses, and conservation organizations that enhance cross-jurisdiction management and address biodiversity conservation in grassland landscapes, rather than pastures. © 2019","Augustine, D.; Davidson, A.; Dickinson, K.; Van Pelt, B.","","",2019,"Conservation Reserve Program; fire; fragmentation; grazing; landscape connectivity","","","","","","","","",""

This global shift in human behavior has contributed to the adoption of strict policies that govern the purposeful and planned use of fire in ecosystem science and management. However, it remains unclear the extent to which modern-day prescribed fire policies are altering the potential magnitude and variation of fire behavior in scientific investigations and ecosystem management. Here, we modeled the theoretical historical range of variability (ROV) in fire behavior for the tallgrass prairie ecosystem of North America. We then compared sensitivities in the magnitude and variation in the historical ROV in fire behavior as a result of (1) policies governing prescribed fire and (2) woody and herbaceous plant invasions. Although considerably more attention has focused on changes in fire behavior as a result of biological invasions, our model demonstrates that contemporary fire management policies can meet or surpass these effects. Policies governing prescribed fire management in tallgrass prairie reduced the magnitude and variability of surface fire behavior more than tall fescue invasion and rivaled reductions in fire behavior from decades of Juniperus encroachment. Consequently, fire and its potential as a driver of ecosystem dynamics has been simplified in the study and management of this system, which may be contributing to misleading conclusions on the potential responses of many highly researched environmental priorities. We emphasize the need to study changes in fire dynamics as a function of both social and ecological drivers, in an effort to advance our basic understanding of the role of fire in nature and its potential usefulness in ecosystem management. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Carlson, J.D.; Engle, D.M.; Fuhlendorf, S.D.; Hiatt, W.B.; Ramirez, A.L.; Taylor Winter, J.; Twidwell, D.; West, A.S.","","19",2016,"anthropogenic change; community assembly; disturbance regime; ecosystem management; environmental policy; exotic species invasion; global environmental change; historical range of variability (ROV); social-ecological system","","","","","","","","",""

We examined plant productivity as measured by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over a 24-year period from 1983–2006 in bird conservation regions (BCRs) that overlapped Bullock’s oriole (Icterus bullockii) breeding, moult, and wintering ranges to ask whether plant productivity in 1 year influences population abundance in the subsequent breeding season. Bullock’s orioles have a moult-migration strategy, with a stopover moult in the Mexican monsoon region, which necessitates examining each stationary phase of the bird’s annual cycle to understand the impacts of environmental factors on population abundance. Our results show increased breeding abundance in three (Great Basin, Coastal California and Shortgrass Prairies) of the six BCRs in which the species breeds following years with high NDVI values. We did not detect a response of breeding abundance to high NDVI values in the previous year in either the moulting region or in their primary over-wintering area in central Mexico. Our results demonstrate that large-scale annual variation in primary productivity on the breeding grounds can have an impact on breeding abundance in the following season, but further studies on migratory connectivity and on ecological mechanisms during the non-breeding seasons are needed to understand why we did not detect an influence of productivity during these periods. © 2014, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.","Flood, N.J.; Pillar, A.G.; Reudink, M.W.; Wilson, S.","","57",2015,"Abundance; BBS; Bullock’s oriole; Climate; Long-term; NDVI","","","","","","","","",""

The results were equivocal regarding the monophyly of the tribe, apparently because of low phylogenetic signal towards the base of the tree; however, analyses of 81 taxa recovered two well-supported clades that together included all sampled Chiasmini. CladeI was resolved as (Leofa (Nephotettix, Exitianus)); cladeII included the remaining 13 sampled genera. Most relationships between genera and species of Chiasmini were strongly supported.

Coyotes (Canis latrans) and gray wolves (C. lupus) are historically sympatric in western North America. Following European settlement gray wolf range contracted, whereas coyote range expanded to include eastern North America. Furthermore, wolves with New World (NW) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes now extend from Manitoba to Québec in Canada and hybridize with gray wolves and coyotes. Using mtDNA and 12 microsatellite markers, we evaluated levels of wolf-coyote hybridization in regions where coyotes were present (the Canadian Prairies, n = 109 samples) and absent historically (Québec, n = 154). Wolves with NW mtDNA extended from central Saskatchewan (51°N, 69°W) to northeastern Québec (54°N, 108°W). On the Prairies, 6.3% of coyotes and 9.2% of wolves had genetic profiles suggesting wolf-coyote hybridization. In contrast, 12.6% of coyotes and 37.4% of wolves in Québec had profiles indicating hybrid origin. Wolves with NW and Old World (C. lupus) mtDNA appear to form integrated populations in both regions.

A secondary purpose was to evaluate an hypothesis (Strong &amp; Hills, 2003) to explain the disjunct distribution of species in western Alberta. Location: Hudson Bay-Lake Michigan to the Rocky Mountains region, north of 36° N to the Arctic Ocean (c. 70° N). Methods: Pollen profiles spanning 40 years of palaeoecological research in North America were extracted from published and unpublished archival sources. Individual profiles were subdivided into 1000-year increments based on the assumption of a constant sedimentation rate between stratigraphic dates (e.g. surface sediments, radiocarbon 14C dates, tephra layers). The pollen composition among profiles was standardized to 54 commonly recognized taxa, with percentage composition within each stratigraphic sample prorated to 100% prior to analysis. Near-surface sediments from these profiles were included as analogues of modern vegetation. Cluster analysis was used as a guide to the classification of 2356 temporal stratigraphic samples, which resulted in the recognition of 16 pollen groups. These groups were summarized in terms of their pollen composition, mapped, and used in combination with terrain information and an ecological knowledge of the study area to construct six physiognomically- based palaeovegetation zonation models at 2000-year intervals from 14,000 to 4000 yr BP (radiocarbon years before present). Results: The 14,000 yr BP model placed Boreal and Cordilleran Forests proximal to the southern glacial front, whereas Arctic tundra dominated the Yukon Territory-Alaska ice-free zone. Pollen and macrofossil evidence suggests that this Boreal Forest zone contained a mixture of coniferous and deciduous tree species. Grassland was postulated immediately south of the forest zone, with its northern extreme near 49° N latitude in the Alberta-Montana border area. Separation of the Laurentide and Cordilleran glacial fronts about 12,000 yr BP initiated the northward advance of Boreal Forests into western Canada. By the end of the Hypsithermal at about 6000 yr BP, Boreal Forests occurred near the Arctic Ocean, and Grassland and Aspen Parkland zones may have extended to 54° N and 59° N latitude in Alberta, respectively. Between 6000 and 4000 yr BP, a 5° and 1° latitudinal southward shift of the northern Boreal Forest and Grassland/Aspen Parkland boundaries occurred, respectively, near their contemporary positions with corresponding expansions of the Subarctic and Arctic zones. Modern Canadian Cordilleran Forests along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains were interpreted as originating from the north-central Montana-south-western Alberta area. Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), a common Boreal Forest species, appears to have entered central Canada via the north side of Lake Superior after 11,000 yr BP. Main conclusions: Modern vegetation in central Canada evolved from biomes located in the northern USA during the late-Quaternary. The Boreal Forest biome contained the same arboreal taxa as the modern vegetation, except it lacked jack pine.

A large shift was found in the compositional mix of 26 species of C3's and 17 species of C4's grown from a native soil seed bank in a competitive mode along a CO2 gradient that approximated the CO2 increase of the past 150 years and before. The biomass of C3's increased from near zero to 50 % of the total while that of the C4's was reduced 25 % as CO2 levels approached current ambient. The proposition that acclimation to rising CO2 will largely negate the fertilization effect of higher CO2 levels on C3's is not supported. No signs of photosynthetic acclimation were evident for Avena sativa, Prosopis glandulosa, and Schizachyrium scoparium plants grown in subambient CO2. The effects of changing CO2 levels on vegetation since the last glaciation are thought to have been at least as great, if not greater, than those which should be expected for a doubling of current CO2 levels.

However, there are concerns that increased methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) emissions associated with restoration may outweigh potential benefits. A comprehensive, 4-year study of 119 wetland catchments was conducted in the Prairie Pothole Region of the north-central U.S. to assess the effects of land use on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and soil properties.Results showed that the effects of land use on GHG fluxes and abiotic soil properties differed with respect to catchment zone (upland, wetland), wetland classification, geographic location, and year. Mean CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes from the uplands were predictably low (<0.02gCH<inf>4</inf>m-2day-1), while wetland zone CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes were much greater (<0.001-3.9gCH<inf>4</inf>m-2day-1). Mean cumulative seasonal CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes ranged from roughly 0-650gCH<inf>4</inf>m-2, with an overall mean of approximately 160g CH<inf>4</inf> m-2. These maximum cumulative CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes were nearly 3 times as high as previously reported in North America. The overall magnitude and variability of N<inf>2</inf>O fluxes from this study (<0.0001-0.0023gN<inf>2</inf>Om-2day-1) were comparable to previously reported values.Results suggest that soil organic carbon is lost when relatively undisturbed catchments are converted for agriculture, and that when non-drained cropland catchments are restored, CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes generally are not different than the pre-restoration baseline.

This group of animals has a long complex evolutionary history, which witnessed severe environmental changes. In this paper, a comprehensive approach integrating information from fossil records, morphological, molecular and geographical data of extant species, and events of paleoclimate and paleogeography, were used to explore the evolutionary processes in the Xerinae. Xerinae probably originated in Eurasia around the early Oligocene, and dispersed to Africa via the Africa-Eurasia Land Bridge on two occasions during the Miocene, and subsequently evolved into the Protoxerini and African Xerini. The tribe Marmotini derived from a Eurasian ancestor and thrived in North America. Tamias re-occupied Eurasia in the early Miocene, while the distributions of Marmota and 'Spermophilus' genus-groups were restricted to North America at least until the late Miocene. Global cooling and the emergence of grass-dominated ecosystems from 15 Ma are likely to be the main causes for the radiation of Marmotini. The body form of Xerinae displays an allometric mode of evolution, with ground-living taxa, such as Marmota, Cynomys and Xerus notably enlarged, while Tamias has remained slim in body form. To cope with the global environmental changes, particularly the global cooling induced forest degradation and grassland expansion in the late Miocene, most Marmotini developed into true ground squirrels with short tails. The slim body adaptation in Tamias may be related to competition from tree squirrels, or their hoarding behavior, the latter helping them to cope with cold winter. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ge, D.Y.; Liu, X.; Lv, X.F.; Xia, L.; Yang, Q.S.; Zhang, Z.Q.","","41",2014,"Body form; Evolution; Historical biogeography; Phylogeny; Xerinae","","","","","","","","",""

Grassland management techniques such as fertilization and haying can influence both SOC and soil N transformations. In mesic grasslands, where SOC can be high compared with drier regions, it is unclear to what extent heterotrophic denitrifiers will respond to such management practices. Biomass removal via haying can reduce SOC, whereas fertilization decreases C:N ratios of plant residues, which can decrease or increase heterotrophic microbial activity, respectively. We experimentally manipulated haying and fertilization regimens on a grassland in northeastern Kansas and measured resulting inorganic N availability, field fluxes of N2O and potential denitrification, and litter C:N ratios to assess how these management practices may influence soil N2O evolution. We observed N2O fluxes that were an order of magnitude larger than those reported in drier grassland systems with lower SOC. The largest N2O fluxes observed were in fertilized and fertilized/hayed plots, immediately after precipitation events. Haying periodically mitigated N2O fluxes. Denitrification enzyme activity was lower in hayed plots than unhayed plots, and greater with glucose-C additions, indicating that the C substrate in these soils is an important driver of denitrification. The N2O fluxes that represented at least 0.1% of available inorganic N exhibited a weak negative relationship with C:N ratios of litter in fertilized/hayed plots, suggesting that the lower C:N ratios associated the shift to C3 plants with fertilization may promote soil N2O production, in addition to SOC and inorganic N availability. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Billings, S.A.; Tiemann, L.K.","","173",2008,"Fertilization; Grassland; Haying; N2O; Soil organic carbon","","","","","","","","",""

Given the scales of change associated with agriculture, effective analysis of the impact of biomass production on species abundance requires science and practice to address multiple measures of agricultural change. We analyzed the response of avian species abundance to multiple measures of agricultural change over a 40-year period along the 41st parallel in the central United States, an area that is perhaps the most agriculturally expansive, intensive, and productive in the world. We prepared indexes of change for area farmed, chemicals used, and biomass produced. Competing singular and additive model combinations were evaluated using Akaike's information criterion model selection and used to estimate abundance of fifty-five species of birds. The negative response of among grassland birds to both agricultural expansion and intensification suggests successful conservation in highly productive agroecoregions must consider elements of both land-sparing and land-sharing approaches. The response of nongrassland obligates to intensification and expansion was mixed, and conservation efforts may need to combine local and regional data to design successful management strategies. Inclusion of multiple processes of agricultural change provides greater insight for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

New AMS 14C dating, together with mineralogical, geochemical, and lithostratigraphic analyses of the 14-m-thick, offshore sediment sequence, document a complex Holocene history in which water levels and limnological conditions were controlled by the interplay of changing climate, variable river and groundwater inflow, and differential isostatic rebound. Varves, ice-rafted debris, and clast-rich laminated sediment record deposition in the lake when the basin was part of proglacial Lake Agassiz. As Agassiz retreated northward, Lake Manitoba became isolated by about 8500 14C yrs BP, and for the next 800 years was characterized by mainly shallow water to dry conditions. Deeper and more stable water conditions returned to the Lake Manitoba basin by 7700 14C yrs BP probably due to the damming effect of differential isostatic rebound and decreasing aridity. For the next 3000 years, relatively stable lake levels and water compositions were maintained, reflecting a delicate balance between differential isostatic rebound, climate, inflow of the Assiniboine River, and groundwater contribution. At ∼4500 14C yrs BP the Assiniboine River was rerouted to its present easterly path, by-passing Lake Manitoba, and resulting in loss of a significant component of the lake's hydrologic budget. Water levels dropped and the offshore sediments were once again subaerially exposed. By 3700 14C yrs BP, a cooler and wetter climate, together with continued southward transgression of water, compensated for the loss of fluvial input, resulting in reflooding of the basin.

Furthermore, they provide information on snow mass, i.e., snow water equivalent (SWE), which is critically important for hydrological modeling and water resource management. However, the errors associated with the passive microwave measurements of SWE are well known but have not been adequately quantified thus far. Understanding these errors is important for correct interpretation of remotely sensed SWE and successful assimilation of such observations into numerical models. This study uses a novel approach to quantify these errors by taking into account various factors that impact passive microwave responses from snow in various climatic/geographic regions. Among these factors are vegetation cover (particularly forest cover), snow morphology (crystal size), and errors related to brightness temperature calibration. A time-evolving retrieval algorithm that considers the evolution of snow crystals is formulated. An error model is developed based on the standard error estimation theory. This new algorithm and error estimation method is applied to the passive microwave data from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) during the 1990-1991 snow season to produce annotated error maps for North America. The algorithm has been validated for seven snow seasons (from 1988 to 1995) in taiga, tundra, alpine, prairie, and maritime regions of Canada using in situ SWE data from the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) and satellite passive microwave observations. An ongoing study is applying this methodology to passive microwave measurements from Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR); future study will further refine and extend the analysis globally, and produce an improved SWE dataset of more than 25 years in length by combining SSMR and SSM/I measurements.","Chang, A.; Dong, J.; Foster, J.L.; Kelly, R.; Powell, H.; Sun, C.; Walker, J.P.","","94",2005,"Observation errors; Passive microwave; SMMR; SSM/I; Snow cover; Snow water equivalent; Uncertainty","","","","","","","","",""

Recent evidence has shown that plants may assimilate amino acids (AAs) directly, circumventing the mineralization pathway. However, the general abundance of soil AAs and their relative importance in plant N uptake remains unclear in most ecosystems. We compared the concentrations and potential production rates of AAs and NH4+, as well as the edaphic factors that influence AA dynamics, in 84 soils across the United States. Across all sites, NH4+ and AA-N comprised similar proportions of the total bioavailable N pool (~20%), with NO3- being the dominant form of extractable N everywhere but in tundra and boreal forest soils. Potential rates of AA production were at least comparable to those of NH4+ production in all ecosystems, particularly in semi-arid grasslands, where AA production rates were six times greater than for NH4+ (P &lt; 0.01). Potential rates of proteolytic enzyme activity were greatest in bacteria-dominated soils with low NH4+ concentrations, including many grassland soils. Based on research performed under standardized laboratory conditions, our continental-scale analyses suggest that soil AA and NH4+ concentrations are similar in most soils and that AAs may contribute to plant and microbial N demand in most ecosystems, particularly in ecosystems with N-poor soils. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Colman, B.P.; Fierer, N.; Hofmockel, K.S.; Jackson, R.B.","","163",2010,"Amino acid; Ammonium; Nitrification; Nitrogen mineralization; Organic N; Protein mineralization; Proteolysis; Soil N cycle","","","","","","","","",""

Despite their ecological differences, their molar morphology is similar. Assuming that those ecologic differences occurred in the past, differentiation of these two taxa is important for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. A sample of 51 lower first molars from living populations were viewed via scanning electron microscope to qualify and quantify schmelzmuster (enamel microstructure) to species-specific standards applicable to the fossil record. The most obvious differences between schmelzmuster of the two taxa are the relatively thicker bands of radial enamel on the leading edges of triangles of M. ochrogaster, as well as the consistent retention of tangential or primitive tangential enamel on the trailing edges and posterior enamel band of the posterior loop of M. pinetorum. Discriminant analysis of landmark data from the same 51 specimens established morphological boundaries for these taxa and successfully separated the recent m1s of M. ochrogaster from those of M. pinetorum.

Schrad.] is an annual broadleaf weed species native to Eurasia and introduced as an ornamental to the Americas by immigrants in the mid- to late 1800s. Although sometimes categorized in the genus Bassia, there is no compelling reason for this classification. This naturalized species is a common and economically important weed in crop production systems and ruderal areas in semiarid to arid regions of North America, and has expanded northward in the Canadian Prairies during the past 30 yr. Although primarily self-pollinated, substantial pollen-mediated gene flow and efficient seed dispersal aids both short- and long-distance spread. The weed is morphologically highly variable, and its growth and development are markedly affected by environmental conditions. Kochia, a C4 species, is highly competitive in cropping systems because of its ability to germinate at low soil temperatures and emerge early, grow rapidly, tolerate heat, drought and salinity, and exert allelopathic effects on neighboring species. Moreover, herbicidal control has been compromised to some extent by the widespread evolution of herbicide resistance in the species. Kochia is used as a forage, is palatable to livestock with nutritional value similar to that of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), but can be toxic if it comprises the majority of the diet. Although kochia pollen is an allergen, the seed is a source of phytochemicals including mosquito pheromones and saponins that are potentially beneficial to human health; kochia also is beneficial in phytoremediation of soils contaminated by hydrocarbons or pesticides.","Beckie, H.J.; Friesen, L.F.; Van Acker, R.C.; Warwick, S.I.","","89",2009,"Bassia scoparia; Herbicide resistance; Kochia; Kochia scoparia; Soil salinity tolerance; Weed biology","","","","","","","","",""

Recent work suggests asymmetrical Holocene behavior, with a relatively rapid early Holocene deforestation and more gradual reforestation later in the Holocene. This paper presents a new synthesis of the Holocene history of the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone in the north-central US and central Canada that updates prior mapping efforts and systematically assesses rates of change. Changes in percent woody cover (%WC) are inferred from fossil pollen records, using the modern analog technique and surface-sediment pollen samples cross-referenced against remotely sensed observations. For contemporary pollen samples from the Great Plains, %WC linearly correlates to percent arboreal pollen (%AP), but regression parameters vary interregionally. At present, %AP is consistently higher than %WC, because of high background levels of arboreal pollen. Holocene maps of the eastern prairie-forest ecotone agree with prior maps, showing a rapid decrease in %WC and eastward prairie advance between 10,000 and 8000 ka (1 ka = 1000 calibrated years before present), a maximum eastward position of the ecotone from 7 to 6 ka, and increased %WC and westward prairie retreat after 6 ka. Ecotone position is ambiguous in Iowa and southeastern Minnesota, due to a scarcity of modern analogs for early-Holocene samples with high Ulmus abundances and for samples from alluvial sediments. The northern prairie-forest ecotone was positioned in central Saskatchewan between 12 and 10 ka, stabilized from 10 to 6 ka despite decreases in %WC at some sites, then moved south after 6 ka. In both east and north, ecotonal movements are consistent with a dry early Holocene and increasing moisture availability after 6 ka. Sites near the ecotone consistently show an asymmetric pattern of abrupt early Holocene deforestation (< 300 years) and gradual reforestation after 6 ka. Early Holocene decreases in %WC are faster than the corresponding drops in %AP, because the analog-based %WC reconstructions correct for the high background levels of arboreal pollen types that blur temporal variations in %AP. For example, at Elk Lake, the %AP decline lasts 1000 years, whereas the %WC decline occurs between adjacent pollen samples, approximately 300 years apart. Thus, early Holocene deforestation may have been even more abrupt than previously recognized. Rapid deforestation likely was promoted both by rapid climate changes around 8.2 ka and positive fire-vegetation feedbacks. Non-linear vegetational responses to hydrological variability are consistent with 1) other paleorecords showing rapid die-offs of some eastern tree species in response to aridity and 2) observations of threshold-type ecological responses to recent climate events. The 21st-century trajectory for the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone is uncertain, because climate models differ over the direction of regional precipitation trends, but future drying would be more likely to trigger threshold-type shifts in ecotone position. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These Paleoindian colonists initially brought with them technologies developed for adaptation to environments and resources found in North America. As the ice age ended across the New World people adapted more generalized stone tools to exploit changing environments and resources. In the neotropics these changes would have been pronounced as patchy forests and grasslands gave way to broadleaf tropical forests. We document a late Pleistocene/early Holocene stone tool tradition from Belize, located in southern Mesoamerica. This represents the first endogenous Paleoindian stone tool technocomplex recovered from well dated stratigraphic contexts for Mesoamerica. Previously designated Lowe, these artifacts share multiple features with contemporary North and South American Paleoindian tool types. Once hafted, these bifaces appear to have served multiple functions for cutting, hooking, thrusting, or throwing. The tools were developed at a time of technological regionalization reflecting the diverse demands of a period of pronounced environmental change and population movement.

The resulting plant communities adapted to both broad-scale and fine-scale disturbance that resulted in species-rich plant communities. These natural disturbance regimes have been largely replaced by anthropogenic disturbance. While we generally understand grassland response to modern grazing practices, we know much less about plant community response to soil disturbance imbedded within non-focal grazing. Therefore, we used a tracked vehicle to focally disturb soil in a North American mesic mixed prairie that was either undisturbed prairie or prairie with a recent history of disturbance from either grazing or haying. Successional trajectory and recovery time following focal soil disturbance was similar between grazed and hayed plant communities. Species composition did not differ (P < 0.05) between grazed or hayed prairie and the respective undisturbed prairie. Plant species richness and bare ground increased (P < 0.05) following focal soil disturbance in both grazed and hayed communities, but focal soil disturbance combined with either grazing or haying did not change either plant species richness or bare ground more than (P > 0.05) focal soil disturbance alone. Also, the effect of focal soil disturbance was shortlived with recovery in two growing seasons.

Our study region corresponds to the confluence of three air streams that control central North American climates and, hence, should be sensitive to climate change. Sediment cores were analyzed for evidence of Holocene vegetation and fire from tall-grass prairie in eastern North Dakota (Moon Lake), from mixed forest near the prairie border in northwestern Minnesota (Deming Lake), and from mixed forest more remote from prairie in western Wisconsin (Dark Lake). Together with pollen and charcoal analysis, we present a new method for determining δ13C of terrestrial (charred) organic matter and, thus, the relative importance of C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways in past vegetation. Paleorecords were supplemented with surface charcoal accumulation and δ13C from 21 North American lakes that span boreal, deciduous, pine, and mixed forest to tall- and mixed-grass prairie. Surface charcoal and δ13C follow vegetation and climate gradients, with high charcoal accumulation and δ13C (-20‰) in the Plains (Dakotas, Nebraska, and southwest Minnesota) and decreases to the east, west, and north. The δ13C pattern is consistent with observed patterns of C3:C4 dominance across the region. Sediment, pollen, charcoal, and terrestrial δ13C show that vegetation response to climate change varied substantially among tall-grass prairie, bordering woodland, and forest. During maximum aridity (8000-4000 yr BP) prairie vegetation in eastern North Dakota showed a demise of woody vegetation followed by a fluctuating dominance of grasses (40% C4) and forbs. Meanwhile, prairie expanded eastward into northwestern Minnesota, where it produced a shifting dominance between mostly C4 grasses and woody vegetation until more humid conditions and mixed forest developed after 4000 yr BP. Mixed forest in southwestern Wisconsin showed little response to mid-Holocene aridity. Elevated δ13C values from 5000 to 3000 yr BP suggest that composition of grasses changed (to increased C4), although pollen data indicate that the total abundance of grasses remained constant. The increase in C4 grasses at this time is consistent with previous studies suggesting a delayed dry interval in eastern Iowa. Reduced aridity of the last 2000 yr brought increased fire to tall-grass prairie as higher primary productivity led to increased fuel load. Meanwhile, forest expanded in northwestern Minnesota, leading to decreased ignition and fine fuels, in turn resulting in decreased fire at the woodland margin.","Clark, J.S.; Grimm, E.C.; Lynch, J.; Mueller, P.G.","","82",2001,"C4; Carbon isotopes; Charcoal analysis; Climate change; Fire; Holocene climate change and vegetation effects; Northern Great Plains (USA); Paleoecological data; Pollen analysis; Prairie; Woodland; δ13C determination methodology","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies of Eocene-Oligocene paleosols in Wyoming and South Dakota suggest a transition from woodland to grassland ecosystems in response to global cooling and drying. We describe four paleosol types from the study area. Type I paleosols include compound Entisols characterized by shallow networks of fine rhizoliths and ichnofaunal assemblages of Planolites isp., Pallichnus dakotensis, Macanopsis isp., Celliforma ficoides, and vertebrate coprolites. Type II paleosols are compound Inceptisols characterized by elongate rhizoliths and ichnofaunal assemblages of Planolites isp., Pallichnus dakotensis, Macanopsis isp., and vertebrate tracks. Type III paleosols are cumulative Inceptisols characterized by elongate rhizolith and ichnofaunal assemblages of Planolites isp., Pallichnus dakotensis, Macanopsis isp., Parowanichnus isp., Edaphichnium isp., and backfilled burrows. Type IV paleosols include composite Inceptisols characterized by large rhizoliths and ichnofaunal assemblages of Edaphichnium isp., Fictovichnus parvus, and wasp cocoons. The vertical transition from less-well-developed (Type I) to better-developed (Type IV) paleosols records decreasing rates of sedimentation and erosion, increasing rates of pedogenesis, and a transition in landscapes from grasslands to savannahs and woodlands. The effects of global cooling on the paleosols and soil biota, therefore, appear to have been buffered by basin-scale, autogenic, sedimentologic, and hydrologic processes.

On northern continents, this turnover is well established by the late early Miocene. However, this transition is poorly documented on southern landmasses, particularly on continental Africa, where no late Paleogene terrestrial snake assemblages are documented south of the equator. Here we describe a newly discovered snake fauna from the Late Oligocene Nsungwe Formation in the Rukwa Rift Basin of Tanzania. The fauna is small but diverse with eight identifiable morphotypes, comprised of three booids and five colubroids. This fauna includes Rukwanyoka holmani gen. et sp. nov., the oldest boid known from mainland Africa. It also provides the oldest fossil evidence for the African colubroid clade Elapidae. Colubroids dominate the fauna, comprising more than 75% of the recovered material. This is likely tied to local aridification and/or seasonality and mirrors the pattern of overturn in later snake faunas inhabiting the emerging grassland environments of Europe and North America. The early emergence of colubroid dominance in the Rukwa Rift Basin relative to northern continents suggests that the pattern of overturn that resulted in extant faunas happened in a more complex fashion on continental Africa than was previously realized, with African colubroids becoming at least locally important in the late Paleogene, either ahead of or as a consequence of the invasion of colubrids. The early occurrence of elapid snakes in the latest Oligocene of Africa suggests the clade rapidly spread from Asia to Africa, or arose in Africa, before invading Europe. © 2014 McCartney et al.","McCartney, J.A.; O'Connor, P.M.; Stevens, N.J.","","9",2014,"","","","","","","","","",""

However, the paleoecological meaning of δ13C values in pedogenic carbonate can change with the scale at which one considers the data. We describe studies of modern soils, fossil soils, and vegetation change in the Chihuahuan Desert of North America and elsewhere that reveal four scales important for paleoecologic interpretations. (1) At the broadest scale, the biome scale (hundreds to millions of km 2), an isotopic record interpreted as C3 vegetation replacing C4 grasslands may indicate invading C3 woody shrubs instead of expanding C3 forests (a common interpretation). (2) At the landscape scale (several tens of m2 to hundreds of km 2), the accuracy of scaling up paleoclimatic interpretations to a regional level is affected by the landform containing the isotopic record. (3) At the soil-profile scale (cm2 to m2), soil profiles with multiple generations of carbonate mixed together have a lower-resolution paleoecologic record than soil profiles repeatedly buried. (4) At the rhizosphere scale (μm2 to cm2), carbonate formed on roots lack the 14-17‰ enrichment observed at broader scales, revealing different fractionation processes at different scales.

In this study, DEMETER is applied to the two following climatic regimes: (1) the modern observed climate and (2) a simulated mid‐Holocene climate (6000 years before present). The mid‐Holocene climate is simulated using the GENESIS global climate model, where shifts in the Earth's orbital parameters result in warmer northern continents and enhanced monsoons in Asia, North Africa, and North America. DEMETER simulates large differences between modern and mid‐Holocene vegetation cover: (1) mid‐Holocene boreal forests extend farther poleward than present in much of Europe, Asia, and North America, and (2) mid‐Holocene North African grasslands extend substantially farther north than present. The simulated patterns of mid‐Holocene vegetation are consistent with many features of the paleobotanical record. Simulated mid‐Holocene global net primary productivity is approximately 3% larger than present, largely due to the increase of boreal forest and tropical grasslands relative to tundra and desert. Global vegetation carbon is higher at 6 kyr B.P. compared to present by roughly the same amount (4%). Mid‐Holocene global litter carbon is larger than present by 10%, while global soil carbon is approximately 1% less. Despite the regional changes in productivity and carbon storage the simulated total carbon storage potential of the terrestrial biosphere (not including changes in peat) does not change significantly between the two simulations.

It was followed by a period of mild climate termed the Sangamon Interglacial Episode. Relatively few reptile fossil sites have been found along the Illinois-Sangamon boundary. Thus, the 1986 report of isolated fossil remains of a giant tortoise (Hesperotestudo) near the boundary is of particular significance. We re-examined this important fossil because of inconsistencies and misinterpretations of prior researchers. The three morphological characters used for prior species identification of the tortoise are faulty and unreliable. Lack of additional, pertinent, diagnostic fossil elements presently prevents positive species identification. We critically appraised the pollen-based analysis of climate and environment at the tortoise strata by prior researchers. Their data suggest a transitional area between forest and prairie, or savannah, but the prior researchers misinterpreted their own data, concluding the vegetation was “relatively xeric grassland”. Consequently, the climate and environment at the tortoise stratum are yet to be determined. We present several zoogeographical scenarios pertaining to the origin and movement of the tortoise to the collection site. The most likely is perhaps northward movement from the central Gulf Coast along the Mississippi River floodplain before the major meltdown of the Illinois glaciation. East of St. Louis, the glacier met the Mississippi River floodplain and as the meltdown progressed, the tortoise could have travelled on the till plain north-east to the collection site. Hesperotestudo likely had considerable cold adaptation and thus may have tracked the Illinois glacier relatively closely as it melted northward. © 2018, British Herpetological Society.","Brown, E.S.; Brown, L.E.; Moll, D.","","28",2018,"Climate; Giant fossil tortoises; Hesperotestudo; Zoogeography","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigate the role of biogeography and the evolution of ecological traits on the diversification of the Holarctic arcto-alpine butterfly genus Oeneis (Lepidoptera: Satyrinae). We reconstructed the molecular phylogeny of the genus based on one mitochondrial ( COI) and three nuclear ( GAPDH, RpS5, wingless) genes. We inferred the biogeographical scenario and the ancestral state reconstructions of climatic and habitat requirements. Within the genus, we detected five main species groups corresponding to the taxonomic division and further paraphyletic position of Neominois (syn. n.). Next, we transferred O. aktashi from the hora to the polixenes species group on the bases of molecular relationships. We found that the genus originated in the dry grasslands of the mountains of Central Asia and dispersed over the Beringian Land Bridges to North America several times independently. Holarctic mountains, in particular the Asian Altai Mts. and Sayan Mts., host the oldest lineages and most of the species diversity. Arctic species are more recent, with Pliocene or Pleistocene origin. We detected a strong phylogenetic signal for the climatic niche, where one lineage diversified towards colder conditions.

In the mid Miocene these habitats supported substantially more brachydont (browsing) species than do any present-day savanna habitats. We present some preliminary data to show that such species-rich browser communities are not observed after the mid Miocene. The data also suggest that these mid Miocene browser communities and their subsequent disappearance may have been a global phenomenon. We then focus on possible explanations for these observations. We discuss the possibility that the high species numbers are a preservational artifact, and conclude that taphonomic factors are unlikely to be responsible for the level of species richness observed. We then consider various possible explanations for high species richness, including the unique aspects of climatic change (cooling, drying, increased seasonality), unique biotic interactions (the effects of competition, keystone herbivores, changes in predator pressure), and consider that none of these are fully consistent with the available data. The most likely explanation for the observed species-rich browser palaeocommunities is an elevated level of primary productivity, relative to the present day, within (at least some) mid Miocene grassland habitats. Such an increase in productivity could possibly have been the result of higher-than-present levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the mid Miocene, but this conflicts with current interpretations of geochemical evidence, and a satisfactory mechanism for the inferred increased primary productivity is an unresolved issue. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, competing hypotheses from multiple paleoecological proxies support one of three hypotheses: that northward C4 expansion occurred at the expense of C3 woodlands, C3 grasslands, or was not occurring during the Hemphillian. We test these alternative hypotheses by comparing the ecosystems of Hemphillian Texas and Nebraska (6.3-7.5Ma) using hoofed mammal dietary reconstruction (hypsodonty and digestive strategy) and by incorporating published tooth enamel isotopes, paleosol isotopes, and phytolith assemblage data. We also use hypsodonty, mesowear, and microwear in a detailed comparison of two localities that are roughly contemporary (Cambridge, Nebraska at 7Ma and Coffee Ranch, Texas at 6.6Ma) to rule out time averaging as an explanatory variable. Through analogy with modern African communities, we reconstruct Texas and Nebraska ecosystems as bushland and woodland, respectively. Using the proportions of hypsodont taxa we estimate mean annual precipitation values of 1217mm/year for Nebraska and 1368mm/year for Texas. Using rarefaction we also do not find differences in the richness of brachydont, hypsodont, and hindgut fermenting taxa. We therefore conclude that both ecosystems were largely similar in hoofed mammal faunal structure during the late Miocene. When compared to published paleosol and phytolith data, which show no differences in C3/C4 biomass among latitudes, our results allow us to reject hypotheses of northward C4 expansion during the late Miocene. We therefore suggest that the equid enamel isotopes may have been biased by two potential factors: the primary reliance on a single locality of appropriate age and possible behavioural lag in C4 feeding among Nebraska equids. These results suggest that the formation of a modern C3/C4 latitudinal gradient occurred later than is previously suggested by equid enamel carbon isotopes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Fraser, D.; Theodor, J.M.","","369",2013,"C4; Grassland; Hypsodonty; Mesowear; Microwear; Miocene","","","","","","","","",""

We combined molecular marker data and previously published fossil data to reconstruct the late Quaternary history of a grassland-dependent species, the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), and to determine whether populations from Pleistocene refugia in the Columbia Basin, eastern Beringia, and Great Plains persisted into the Holocene and Recent eras. Using DNA extracted from 97 museum specimens of extirpated populations, we amplified 309 bp of the mtDNA control region, and 8 microsatellite markers from the nuclear genome. Overall haplotype diversity from 309 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was low (5 haplotypes, nucleotide diversity = 0.001 ± 0.001 SD) and was contained within a single phylogenetic clade. The star phylogeny and unimodal mismatch distribution indicated that a rapid range expansion from a single Pleistocene refugium occurred. Microsatellite data corroborated this genetic pattern: populations from the mixed grasslands of the Great Plains had significantly higher expected heterozygosity and allelic richness than populations to the west (HE = 0.66 versus 0.41, AR = 4.3 versus 2.7, respectively), and θ, a measure of relative population size, was substantially greater in the east than west (2.4 versus 0.7). We infer from these data that black-footed ferrets rapidly colonized western ecoregions in a stepwise fashion from the Great Plains to the intermountain regions of the Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau after the last ice age.

Previous calibration studies have examined a limited number of species or individuals, and most have focused on larger (&gt; 10 mm) taxa, which do not represent the dominant shell material in the Quaternary fossil record. In this study, we evaluate the δ18O values of small land snails (&lt; 10 mm), which are common in modern settings and are often preserved in a wide array of Quaternary geologic and archeologic deposits. Our primary goal was to determine if coexisting species record equivalent isotopic information in their shells, regardless of differences in their ecology, dietary habits, behavior, and/or body size. We collected and analyzed 265 individuals of 11 species from 12 sites in northwest Minnesota (USA), which exhibits extremely abundant and diverse terrestrial malacofauna in North America. We did not observe significant correlations between shell δ18O values and the type of ecosystem (forest/grassland) or hydrologic setting (upland/lowland). However, the majority of species differed significantly in shell δ18O values. Larger taxa (Catinella, Succinea, Discus) consistently yielded higher δ18O values than smaller taxa (Euconulus, Gastrocopta, Hawaiia, Vallonia), by up to ~ 3‰. These isotopic offsets among sympatric taxa could be attributed to a number of physical, behavioral, and/or evolutionary traits, including the ability of larger species to tolerate drier conditions better than their smaller counterparts, differences in their preferred microhabitats or phylogentic non-independence. Regardless of the reason, our results imply that researchers should not combine isotopic data from different types of land snails without first investigating modern specimens to determine if it is appropriate. Moreover, our data suggest that combining instrumental climate data, a snail flux-balance model, and shell δ18O values can help us to better understand the ecology of land snails. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Nekola, J.C.; Pigati, J.S.; Rech, J.A.; Yanes, Y.","","485",2017,"Ecology; Minnesota; Quaternary; Small land snails; Stable isotopes; USA","","","","","","","","",""

Toll-like receptors (TLR) are an innate immune gene family that binds to Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns. These receptors evolved under positive selection and by coevolution; therefore, they represent adaptive genetic diversity.

Although empirical evidence has been equivocal, theory predicts that such adaptations combined with alterations in resources can lead to grazing-induced overcompensation in aboveground net primary production (ANPP; grazed ANPP > ungrazed ANPP) under certain conditions. We tested two specific predictions from theory. First, overcompensation is more likely to occur in annually burned grasslands because limiting nutrients that would be lost with frequent fires are recycled through grazers and stimulate ANPP. Second, overcompensation of biomass lost to grazers is more likely to occur in unburned sites where grazing has the greatest effect on increasing light availability through alterations in canopy structure. Methods: We tested these nutrient versus light-based predictions in grazed grasslands that had been annually burned or protected from fire for >20 years. We assessed responses in ANPP to grazing by large ungulates using both permanent and moveable grazing exclosures (252 exclosures from which biomass was harvested from 3192 quadrats) in a 2-year study. Study sites were located at the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) in North America and at Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa. At KPBS, sites were grazed by North American bison whereas in KNP sites were grazed either by a diverse suite of herbivores (e.g. blue wildebeest, Burchell's zebra, African buffalo) or by a single large ungulate (African buffalo). Important Findings: We found no evidence for overcompensation in either burned or unburned sites, regardless of grazer type. Thus, there was no support for either mechanism leading to overcompensation. Instead, complete compensation of total biomass lost to grazers was the most common response characterizing grazing-ANPP relationships with, in some cases, undercompensation of grass ANPP being offset by increased ANPP of forbs likely due to competitive release. The capability of these very different grass-dominated systems to maintain ANPP while being grazed has important implications for energy flow, ecosystem function and the trophic dynamics of grasslands. © The Author 2012.","Blair, J.M.; Blake, D.; Buis, G.; Burkepile, D.E.; Chamberlain, A.; Collins, S.L.; Fynn, R.W.S.; Govender, N.; Hoover, D.L.; Kirkman, K.P.; Knapp, A.K.; O'Neal, P.; Schreck, T.; Smith, M.D.; Zinn, A.","","5",2012,"Aboveground net primary production; Fire; Forbs; Herbivores; Savanna","","","","","","","","",""

Evolutionary trends in the crown heights of North American ungulates are grossly consistent with a transition from closed forests in the early Eocene to open grasslands in the late Miocene. However, the evolutionary proliferation of hypsodonty (high crowned teeth) in the early and middle Miocene occurs later than the apparent origin of open grassland habitats in North America. The paleoecology of species from the interval between the appearance of grasslands and the evolutionary proliferation of hypsodonty is critical to understanding the role of Cenozoic climate change in mammalian evolution. The paleodiets of late Eocene to middle Miocene oreodonts (Merycoidodontidae) were reconstructed by examining the relative facet development of molars (mesowear). A two-phase diet trend was discovered. Phase 1 suggests either an average reduction in the amount of exogenous grit from the late Eocene to early Oligocene or a decrease in fruit consumption related to the disappearance of more wooded habitats. Phase 2 is a gradual transition from early Oligocene low-abrasion browsing to high abrasion diets similar to mixed feeding and grazing in the Miocene. According to mesowear data, oreodont diets similar to those of modern grazers in terms of abrasion are not seen until the early Miocene (early Hemingfordian land mammal age). The coevolutionary relationship of molar crown height and diet, as represented by mesowear, was examined using phylogenetically independent contrasts. No significant coevolutionary relationship was found. In several instances, diet was found to shift over time despite morphological stasis (i.e. within a single species). These results do not clearly indicate that the overall trend of increasing dietary abrasion imposed sufficient selection to drive crown height evolution in oreodonts. Therefore, direct fossil evidence of dietary abrasion as a causal factor in the evolution of crown height, at least in this clade, is elusive. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Mihlbachler, M.C.; Solounias, N.","","13",2006,"Coevolution; Hypsodonty; Merycoidodontidae; Mesowear; Oreodont; Paleoecology","","","","","","","","",""

This pattern is evident in middle Miocene deposits of Oregon in which the brachydont taxa became extinct while the hypsodont equids flourished. This turnover, associated with morphological tooth differences, is hypothesized to be a result of dietary differences between taxa, with hypsodont species exploiting the increasing grassland landscape and demise of the brachydont species a result of less vegetation suitable for browsers. Here this hypothesis is tested and the dietary niches of four equid genera are examined using stable carbon and oxygen isotopes. Dietary niche partitioning is evident based on δ13C and δ18O values and tooth morphology: Archaeohippus, a small brachydont equid, had a narrow dietary niche most likely consuming crown leaf vegetation in the clearings of a woodland habitat; Parahipppus and Desmatippus, medium sized brachydont to incipiently hypsodont equids, ate C<inf>3</inf> vegetation in a relatively open environment; and aff.

Watts pioneered palaeoecological investigations in the grasslands of the northern Great Plains in central North America. He showed from fossil data that Picea forest covered the plains during the late Pleistocene, as biogeographical evidence suggests. This forest gave way to prairie with some deciduous woodland in the eastern part of the region at the beginning of the Holocene. Greatly fluctuating but on average high amounts of Ambrosia-type and Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae pollen are found throughout the middle Holocene. These high values of Ambrosia-type pollen are puzzling because today Ambrosia is more common in wetter climates to the east of the Great Plains; however, lake levels indicate that the middle Holocene was drier than today. Differences in the seasonality of precipitation may provide the explanation - lake levels respond to precipitation in the period from autumn through to spring, whereas Ambrosia responds to growing-season moisture. High interannual variability in growing-season precipitation may explain the greatly fluctuating values of Ambrosia during the middle Holocene.","Grimm, E.C.","","101",2002,"","","","","","","","","",""

Because most species of grassland birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines, especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296 dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures. Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides further evidence that this practice can be a useful tool for grassland bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation, patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g., trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects of grazing, which are not available under traditional management. Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.","Churchwell, R.T.; Davis, C.A.; Engle, D.M.; Fuhlendorf, S.D.","","72",2008,"Dickcissel; Grazing; Logistic exposure; Nest success; Oklahoma; Patch-burn management; Prescribed fire; Spiza americana; Tallgrass prairie","","","","","","","","",""

Climate change elevates conservation concerns worldwide because it will likely exacerbate a broad range of identified threats to animal populations. In the past few decades, grassland birds have declined faster than other North American avifauna, largely due to habitat threats such as the intensification of agriculture. We examine the effects of local climatic variations on the breeding performance of a bird endemic to the shortgrass prairie, the Lark Bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys) and discuss the implications of our findings relative to future climate predictions. Clutch size, nest survival, and productivity all positively covaried with seasonal precipitation, yet relatively intense daily precipitation events temporarily depressed daily survival of nests. Nest survival was positively related to average temperatures during the breeding season. Declining summer precipitation may reduce the likelihood that Lark Buntings can maintain stable breeding populations in eastern Colorado although average temperature increases of up to 38C (within the range of this study) may ameliorate declines in survival expected with drier conditions. Historic climate variability in the Great Plains selects for a degree of vagility and opportunism rather than strong site fidelity and specific adaptation to local environments. These traits may lead to northerly shifts in distribution if climatic and habitat conditions become less favorable in the drying southern regions of the Great Plains. Distributional shifts in Lark Buntings could be constrained by future changes in land use, agricultural practices, or vegetative communities that result in further loss of shortgrass prairie habitats. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Adams, A.A.Y.; Skagen, S.K.","","22",2012,"Calamospiza melanocorys; Climate change; Clutch size; Lark Bunting; Nest survival; North American prairie birds; Paleoclimate; Precipitation; Shortgrass prairie","","","","","","","","",""

The sequence of cultural and alluvial deposits at the site is one of the most complete records of Holocene human occupation and sedimentation documented in North America, and is very important to the interpretation of the cultural history of the Inner Gulf Coastal Plain and adjacent areas of the Southern Plains. The most salient ecological characteristics of the site are its riparian setting and location in the ecotone between North America's western grasslands and eastern woodlands. The cultural record spans the past 10,000 years and is buried in 14 m of fine-grained flood deposits with multiple buried paleosols. Excavations totaling 730 m2 sampled 20 stratigraphically distinct archaeological components in valley fill beneath the Applewhite terrace, yielding more than 80,000 artifacts, including flakes, tools, bones, mussel shells, and fire-cracked rocks left by Archaic and Late Pre-Columbian hunter-gatherers. Seven primary stratigraphic units and five laterally traceable buried paleosols were identified at the site. The oldest stratigraphic unit consists of coarse-grained channel deposits that accumulated soon before 33,000 14C yr B.P. Most of the units, however, consist of fine-grained alluvium that accumulated between ca. 10,000 and 1000 14C yr B.P. The δ13C values of organic matter from the site's soil-stratigraphic sequence indicate increased C4 production during the Younger Dryas (11,000–10,000 14C yr B.P.), and C4 productivity generally increased throughout the Holocene, culminating in peak warm intervals at ca. 5000 and 2000 14C yr B.P. Although during relatively dry periods grasses expanded at the expense of trees, a mosaic of trees and grasses (i.e., a savannah) typical of a grassland-forest ecotone prevailed at the site throughout the Holocene.

Geographic distributions of cytotypes may refl ect the evolutionary history of autopolyploid formation and subsequent population dynamics including stochastic (drift) and deterministic (diff erential selection among cytotypes) processes. Here, we used a population genomic approach to investigate whether autopolyploidy occurred once or multiple times in Andropogon gerardii, a widespread, North American grass with two predominant cytotypes. M ETHODS: Genotyping by sequencing was used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in individuals collected from across the geographic range of A. gerardii. Two independent approaches to SNP calling were used: the reference-free UNEAK pipeline and a reference-guided approach based on the sequenced Sorghum bicolor genome. SNPs generated using these pipelines were analyzed independently with genetic distance and clustering. KEY RESULTS: Analyses of the two SNP data sets showed very similar patterns of population-level clustering of A. gerardii individuals: a cluster of A. gerardii individuals from the southern Plains, a northern Plains cluster, and a western cluster. Groupings of individuals corresponded to geographic localities regardless of cytotype: 6 x and 9 x individuals from the same geographic area clustered together. CONCLUSIONS: SNPs generated using reference-guided and reference-free pipelines in A. gerardii yielded unique subsets of genomic data. Both data sets suggest that the 9 x cytotype in A. gerardii likely evolved multiple times from 6 x progenitors across the range of the species.

In this context, clonality has been described as a significant factor contributing to invasiveness. We studied the abiotic environment and the responses of different tussock architecture traits of the invasive cordgrass Spartina densiflora Brongn. (Poaceae). A common garden experiment and field studies of S. densiflora in salt marshes across a wide latitudinal gradient from California (USA) to British Columbia (Canada) provided a model system for an integrated study of the potential mechanisms underlying the response of invasive S. densiflora populations to changes in environmental conditions. Our results showed that S. densiflora is able to adjust to widely variable climate (specifically, air temperature and the duration of the growing season) and sediment conditions (specifically, texture and hypoxia) through phenotypical plastic key functional tussock traits (e.g. shoot density, height, above- and below-ground biomass allocation patterns). Root biomass increased in coarser sediments in contrast to rhizomes, which were more abundant in finer sediments. Above-ground biomass and leaf area index increased mainly with air temperature during summer, and more robust (taller and wider) shoots were associated with more oxygenated sediments. In view of our results, S. densiflora appears to be a halophyte with a high degree of phenotypic plasticity that would enable it to respond successfully to changes in the abiotic conditions of salt marshes driven by global climate change, such as increasing salinity and temperatures. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Castillo, J.M.; Figueroa, E.; Grewell, B.J.; Pickart, A.J.; Sytsma, M.","","18",2016,"Anoxia; Climate change; Invasive species; Phenotypic plasticity; Salt marshes; Tussock traits","","","","","","","","",""

In temnocyonines, we see the first carnivorans to occupy an ecological niche as large cursorial predators. The subfamily is confined to the Arikareean NALMA, ranging in age from the latest early Oligocene to the early Miocene. Distributed from the Pacific Northwest to the Great Plains and Florida, there are four genera (Temnocyon, Mammacyon, Delotrochanter n. gen., Rudiocyon n. gen.) and 12 species, of which eight are newly described (Temnocyon subferox, T. fingeruti, T. macrogenys; Rudiocyon amplidens; Mammacyon ferocior; Delotrochanter petersoni, D. oryktes, D. major). Among the specimens examined are eight skulls, three with intact basicranial morphology that establish the presence of a plesiomorphic arctoid auditory region in the subfamily. Temnocyonine dentitions and postcranial skeletons reveal a blend of morphological characteristics not previously nor subsequently seen among the Carnivora. From a stem species, Temnocyon altigenis, there evolve both large hypercarnivorous (Temnocyon) and durophagous forms (Mammacyon, Delotrochanter); these genera share a derived dentition that defines the Temnocyoninae. Delotrochanter oryktes n. sp., an early Miocene species, was found in a den, suggesting a possible burrowing capability and sheltering of offspring. The John Day basin of Oregon and the central Great Plains (western Nebraska, southeast Wyoming) are the source of most temnocyonine fossils; a few have been found in southern California and Florida, indicative of a continent-wide distribution. Temnocyonines have often been confused with canids, however their basicranial anatomy places them securely within the Amphicyonidae. First discovered in the 1870s, only ∼30 individuals comprise the entire record of the subfamily. Many were found in proximity to radioisotopically calibrated tuffs and ignimbrites and/or were closely associated with mammals of established biochronologic age. Thus, most species can be placed in a temporal context. With rare exception, the fossils represent isolated occurrences, hence estimates of variation within a population are lacking. Cursorial postcranial features characterize several lineages (Mammacyon, Delotrochanter) and probably were present in other temnocyonines known only from dental remains. Late Oligocene Mammacyon ferocior and early Miocene Delotrochanter oryktes evolved uniquely configured crushing cheek teeth and cursorial limbs, combining distinctive dental and skeletal traits in a manner not seen in any living carnivore. These species are interpreted as large durophagous predators with craniodental characteristics that parallel living hyaenids (Crocuta crocuta) and postcranial adaptations approaching those of cursorial canids such as the wolf (Canis lupus). Expansion of semiarid grasslands and savanna during the late Oligocene and early Miocene in the central Great Plains seems to have favored the evolution of these wide-ranging durophagous amphicyonid carnivores. Analysis of the jaws of temnocyonines employing Therrien's method of beam analysis demonstrates pronounced bending strength focused beneath the crushing dental battery in the molar region. Similarly, the canines and mandibular symphysis manifest an ability to resist strong parasagittal, transverse, and torsional forces occurring during prey capture and feeding. Temnocyonines share a pronounced similarity in dentition with European haplocyonine beardogs, which doubtless are their sister group among the Amphicyonidae. Some haplocyonines also show cursorial tendencies. Examination of European material, however, reveals subtle dental distinctions indicating that the evolution of the two subfamilies proceeded separately yet in parallel in Europe and North America.

We focused on the effects of neighbouring plant community and soil biota as these biotic factors have been repeatedly put forward to explain invasion success (e.g. as components of the novel weapons and of the biotic release hypothesis). To assess their relative importance in explaining the high impact of Centaurea stoebe during the invasion of new sites in the introduced range, we conducted a greenhouse experiment with both European (EU) and North American (NA) tetraploid C. stoebe competing with/without EU vs. NA neighbouring community and with the two neighbouring communities growing without C. stoebe. Plants were grown in sterilized commercial soil inoculated with naïve soil (from rhizosphere of plants other than C. stoebe) originating either from the home EU or the introduced NA range and half of which was sterilized to remove soil biota. In the competition pots, relative competitive ability (difference between the relative growth rates of C. stoebe and neighbouring community) and impact level (biomass of the neighbouring community relative to that in non-competition pots) of C. stoebe was significantly higher when grown with the NA than with the EU neighbouring community, although growth rates of EU and NA neighbouring communities did not differ in the non-competition pots. Both soil origin and C. stoebe origin had no effect on these processes. Soil sterilization increased growth of both C. stoebe and neighbouring communities, but had only a moderate effect on impact level and type, and no effect on the relative competitive ability of C. stoebe. These results suggest that during the colonization of new sites in North American grasslands, the impact of C. stoebe is strongly driven by reduced competitive ability of NA neighbours compared with EU neighbours, while altered biotic soil conditions in the introduced range and post-introduction evolutionary changes in the invader are of less importance. This differential impact appears to be due to inherently different mechanisms underlying the competitive interactions between EU and NA neighbouring communities when grown with C. stoebe. © 2014 British Ecological Society.","Müller-Schärer, H.; Schaffner, U.; Sun, Y.","","28",2014,"Centaurea stoebe; Competition; Invader impact; Neighbour origin; Plant invasion; Soil origin; Soil sterilization","","","","","","","","",""

Although the role of historical climate change on speciation remains controversial, the impact on genetic variation within species has been well documented. We examined mtDNA sequences from the cytochrome b gene (1117 bp) and a portion of the NADH-4 gene (659 bp) for 286 individuals of Diadophis punctatus to infer phylogeographic patterns and population structure and to examine historical demographic patterns in both glaciated and unglaciated regions of North America. We inferred 14 lineages that replace each other geographically across the United States. Several of these lineages appear to be confined to specific habitats (floodplains, grasslands, montane environments) and traverse previously identified genetic barriers for terrestrial vertebrates including the Mississippi and Apalachicola Rivers, the Appalachian Mountains, and the western continental divide. We also observed overlapping ranges between some haplotype groups and several instances of secondary contact associated with ecological transition zones in eastern South Carolina, southern Oklahoma and central California. Within the US, diversification began during the late Miocene and continued into the mid-Pleistocene, suggesting these lineages pre-dated the last glacial maximum. Coalescent and non-coalescent demographic analyses indicate that independent lineages currently occupying previously glaciated or unsuitable areas in eastern, central and western US underwent post-glacial population expansion likely from southern refugia during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene. Conversely, southern lineages display patterns consistent with long-term population stability. Such long-term persistence of genetic structure may be due to the competitive effects between lineages or ecosystem stability in more southern latitudes. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These deposits also contain eolian dust, especially in paleosols. Eolian dust in these deposits is indicated by several mineralogic and chemical disparities with local bedrock, but it is most readily shown by the abundance of titaniferous magnetite in the sandy deposits that is absent in local bedrock. Magnetite and some potential plant nutrients (especially, P, K, Na, Mn, and Zn) covary positively with depth (3-4 m) in dune-crest and dune-swale settings. Magnetite abundance also correlates strongly and positively with abundances of other elements (e.g., Ti, Li, As, Th, La, and Sc) that are geochemically stable in these environments. Soil-property variations with depth can be ascribed to three primary factors: (1) shifts in local geomorphic setting; (2) accumulation of relatively high amounts of atmospheric mineral dust inputs during periods of land-surface stability; and (3) variations in dust flux and composition that are likely related to changes in dust-source regions. Shifts in geomorphic setting are revealed by large variations in soil texture and are also expressed by changes in soil chemical and magnetic properties. Variable dust inputs are indicated by both changes in dust flux and changes in relations among magnetic, chemical, and textural properties. The largest of these changes is found in sediment that spans late Pleistocene to early Holocene time. Increased dust inputs to the central Colorado Plateau during this period may have been related to desiccation and shrinkage of large lakes from about 12 to 8 ka in western North America that exposed vast surfaces capable of emitting dust. Soil properties that result from variable dust accumulation and redistribution in these surficial deposits during the late Quaternary are important to modern ecosystem dynamics because some plants today utilize nutrients deposited as long ago as about 12-15 ky and because variations in fine-grained (silt) sediment, including eolian dust, influence soil-moisture capacity.","Goldstein, H.; Neff, J.C.; Reheis, M.C.; Reynolds, R.L.; Yount, J.","","66",2006,"Colorado Plateau; Dunes; Eolian dust; Late Quaternary; Paleosol; Soil formation; Soil nutrients","","","","","","","","",""

However, fitness consequences of fragmentation related to mating distance, such as inbreeding depression following increased self- and near-neighbor mating, may not follow standard expectations in species with specialized genetic systems. We investigated the effect of mating distance on progeny fitness in Calylophus serrulatus, a primarily autogamous, permanent translocation heterozygote that is restricted to prairie fragments in the North American tallgrass prairie region. We pollinated flowers by hand in the field with pollen sampled at various distances from the maternal parent within and between three populations in southeastern Minnesota. We raised the progeny in a greenhouse and measured fitness-related characters. Because their genetic system prevents loss of heterozygosity throughout much of the genome, regardless of inbreeding, permanent translocation heterozygotes are not expected to exhibit inbreeding depression. Consistent with this expectation, in no case did progeny of self matings suffer significantly reduced mean fitness compared to progeny from crosses between plants. Crosses between plants in the two closely situated (2 km) populations yielded progeny with fitness intermediate to their parents, but crosses between each of those populations and the more distant (20 km) population yielded progeny with reduced fitness, suggesting outbreeding depression at this largest spatial scale. Similarly, fitness of self-pollinated progeny and progeny from ""near"" crosses (<2 m) within populations tended to be higher than ""mid"" (10-25 m) and ""far"" (>35 m) cross-progeny fitness. Under the current conditions of fragmentation, it seems likely that the distant matings that produce outbreeding depression are rare.

Dung deposited in autumn disintegrated rapidly, leaving patches of bare ground ranging from 50 to 900 cm2. Herbaceous cover on gaps created by dung deposition recovered to levels comparable to neighboring vegetation by the end of the following growing season. Vegetation colonizing gaps consisted primarily of grasses not found in the surrounding vegetation. Dung deposition increased species diversity and spatial heterogeneity of the herbaceous vegetation and contributed to the development of a fine-grain mosaic of small patches of varying successional age-states. The role of cattle in facilitating the ingress and establishment of mesquite has broader implications with regard to the conversion of grasslands to woodlands. On the site with cattle, mesquite seedlings were found in 75% of dung pats surveyed in September (mean =4.2 seedlings per pat; maximum =50). Although seedling survival in dung (79%) was only 16% greater than that of mesquite emerging from seeds experimentally sown away from dung, no seedlings were found on areas without cattle. Mean (± SE) density of mesquite seedlings ranged from 12±2 to 15±2 m-2 on the site with cattle. Seed densities away from parent plants averaged 10.7 m-2 and 0.0 m-2 on areas with and without cattle, respectively. Seed densities beneath adult plants were comparable between sites. The high density of seedlings on areas with cattle, in contrast to absence of seedlings on the area without cattle, suggests rates of invasion of grasslands by mesquite would have increased substantially in North America following the settlement and introduction of domestic ungulates. Prior to the introduction of livestock, poor seed dissemination and germination may have limited its Holocene spread. © 1987 Dr W.

Insights from butterflies in Japan","In humid temperate regions, it has been commonly thought that closed forests represent original states and grasslands are unstable human artifacts that persist only as “semi-natural” states. This perspective underrates grasslands, because it makes the recent decline in grassland excusable. A contrasting perspective was recently proposed for temperate Europe and North America, stating that grasslands are intrinsically natural and stable, and hence could have survived without human presence during the postglacial age. However, few quantitative analyses have been performed to test the validity of these two perspectives. Considering that the evolutionary history of species is reflected in species traits, analyzing traits of grassland species in relation to habitat stability is expected to identify the intrinsic nature of grasslands (stable or unstable) and test the validity of these two perspectives. Here, using temperate Japanese butterflies, I compared ecological traits, geographic range, endemism and habitat types in the Eurasian continent between grassland species and forest (stable habitat) and ruderal (unstable habitat) species. I found that grassland butterflies shared similar ecological traits with forest butterflies, but not with ruderal butterflies. Moreover, grassland butterflies were primarily associated with natural and stable steppes and meadows in the Eurasian continent. Furthermore, Japanese grassland species are evolutionarily unique, nurturing many endemic subspecies with narrow geographic ranges. These results indicate that grasslands should not be regarded as unstable, transient, and artificial, but as intrinsically natural and stable in humid temperate regions. These grasslands may have persisted in a stable state without human intervention during the Holocene due to natural disturbances and severe environmental conditions, which are currently immensely suppressed or altered by human. Such perspective also holds true for humid temperate regions in Europe and North America. Thus, temperate semi-natural grasslands should be conserved with high priority in these regions considering that few natural grasslands are left resulting from the present intensive land use pressures and disturbance suppression. © 2018 The Author","Ohwaki, A.","","16",2018,"Biogeography; Conservation; Ecological traits; Eurasian steppe; Habitat stability; Habitat-templet theory","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unclear how the salinity of wetland ponds will respond to a recent shift in mid-continental climate to wetter conditions. To understand better the mechanisms that control surface-subsurface salinity exchanges during regional dry-wet climate cycles, we made a detailed geoelectrical study of a closed-basin prairie wetland (P1 in the Cottonwood Lake Study Area, North Dakota) that is currently experiencing record wet conditions. We found saline lenses of sulfate-rich porewater (TDS &gt; 10 g L−1) contained in fine-grained wetland sediments 2–4 m beneath the bathymetric low of the wetland and within the currently ponded area along the shoreline of a prior pond stand (c. 1983). During the most recent drought (1988–1993), the wetland switched from a groundwater discharge to recharge function, allowing salts dissolved in surface runoff to move into wetland sediments beneath the bathymetric low of the basin. However, groundwater levels during this time did not decline to the elevation of the saline lenses, suggesting these features formed during more extended paleo-droughts and are stable in the subsurface on at least centennial timescales. We hypothesize a “drought-induced recharge” mechanism that allows wetland ponds to maintain moderate salinity under semiarid climate. Discharge of drought-derived saline groundwater has the potential to increase the salinity of wetland ponds during wet climate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fiorentino, A.J.; Goldhaber, M.B.; LaBaugh, J.W.; Levy, Z.F.; Moucha, R.; Mushet, D.M.; Rosenberry, D.O.; Siegel, D.I.","","557",2018,"Drought; Hydrogeology; Prairie pothole wetlands; Resistivity imaging; Sediment-water exchange; Sulfate","","","","","","","","",""

We reconstructed the Holocene vegetation and fire history of a small watershed to investigate the linkages among disturbance regimes, biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem structure. Specifically we asked: (i) how do compositional and structural changes in forest ecosystems modify fire regimes; and (ii) how do changes in fuel type and fire regimes impact biogeochemical cycling? Location: Comstock Lake, Wisconsin, USA, a small kettle lake at the modern prairie-forest ecotone in the Great Lakes Region of North America. Methods: We analysed a lacustrine sediment core from Comstock Lake, Wisconsin, for paleoecological proxies including charcoal quantity and morphotype, pollen composition, magnetic susceptibility, organic matter concentration and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. These paleoecological variables were used to reconstruct climate-mediated shifts in vegetation, fire disturbance and biogeochemical cycling during the last 13 200 calendar years before present (cal yr BP). Results: Forest composition in the landscape surrounding Comstock Lake varied among coniferous forest, deciduous forest and savanna over the Holocene. Independent of the vegetation changes, five distinct fire regimes were identified, ranging from frequent, low-intensity surface fires to infrequent, high-intensity crown fires. The main feature of our vegetation reconstruction is a shift from Pinus to Quercus forest that occurred between 10 000 and 11 000 cal yr BP. However, changes in fuel source and forest structure were apparently more important than shifts of species composition in determining fire regimes. We observed an inverse relationship between non-arboreal fuel sources and biomass burning throughout all five fire regimes. The biogeochemical consequences of fires were apparent during some, but not all regime transitions. Generally, the sediments were composed of relatively small clastic inputs from the catchment and mostly autochthonous organic sources. Conclusion: The location of Comstock Lake on the prairie-forest boundary meant that regional climate signals during the Holocene were filtered through vegetation. Both compositional changes in dominant tree taxa and structural changes in canopy openness influenced fire regimes. © 2014 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Long, C.J.; Mclauchlan, K.K.; Morris, J.L.; Mueller, J.R.; Nurse, A.","","25",2014,"Charcoal; Deciduous forest; Disturbance; Lake sediments; Nitrogen; Prairie; Wildfire","","","","","","","","",""

Empirical evidence regarding the vegetation of the region from the Late Tertiary to recent is consistent with the idea that the area can support two types of vegetation, grassland or forest, under broadly the same climatic regime and raises questions regarding vegetation-atmosphere interactions. Positive feedbacks relating to surface hydrology may tend to favor forests; positive feedbacks involving fire regime may tend to favor grasslands. It should be possible to use coupled vegetation-climate models to test the idea that vegetation shifts in this region affect hydrologic processes and climates at scales ranging from local to global.

Studies of perennials are particularly needed: most of our knowledge of plant-virus interactions is from annuals, yet long-lived species dominate landscapes. Here we used aster models for life-history analysis and longitudinal measures of plant virus status to evaluate multi-year consequences of crop virus infection in a native perennial. We used Barley yellow dwarf virus acquired from wheat to inoculate seedlings of Panicum virgatum L. (switchgrass), a North American prairie grass. We grew inoculated and mock-inoculated individuals of two ecotypes for 3 years in the field. We measured plant size, infection status and fitness components. Aster modelling provided integrated multi-year measures of fitness. Crop virus inoculation reduced multi-year native plant fitness by 30% over 2 years despite generally asymptomatic infection and evidence of resistance. This reduction was greater than predicted from individual fitness components or most size measures. Ecotypes differed in response, with the lowland ecotype experiencing higher apparent recovery from infection. Virus treatment in the upland ecotype delayed flowering phenology and reduced seed filling. Synthesis. Our use of field experimentation, surveys of plant infection status and aster modelling demonstrates a rigorous and broadly applicable approach for quantifying the effects of viruses and other microbes on multi-year plant fitness. We found that a crop virus had negative multi-year effects on native plant fitness even after infection was no longer detected.

This locality represents deposition on a low-gradient, waterlogged alluvial plain approximately 300 km to the north west of the Bearpaw Sea. Detailed sedimentological analyses suggest an environment characterized by a high-sinuosity channel system responsible for widespread oxbow lakes, bogs and marshes. A total of 260 identifiable elements were recovered from three distinct sites at the Kleskun Hill Park, documenting a diverse terrestrial and fresh-water palaeocommunity. The recovered fossils include those from hatchling- to nestling-sized hadrosaurid dinosaurs, indicating the presence of a nesting ground in the area. This is the first evidence for dinosaur nesting site in the Wapiti Formation and simultaneously an extremely rare evidence of high-latitude dinosaur nesting, the northernmost in North America to date. A large number of teeth of the small theropod Troodon are associated with baby hadrosaurids in the site supporting a northern affinity of this taxon as well as a previously proposed predator-prey association. Other dinosaurs are less common at the locality and include large and small theropods (i.e. tyrannosaurid, Saurornitholestes, Richardoestesia, Paronychodon, and dromaeosaurid) and five ornithischian taxa. Fish, squamate, turtle, and mammal elements were also identified. Collectively, the vertebrate fossil assemblage from the locality allows palaeocommunity reconstruction in the Wapiti Formation. The importance of the data collected from the new locality is twofold: first, they represent the first comprehensive report from a geographically significant area located between the well-sampled fossil localities of southern Alberta and the high-latitude localities of Alaska.

This is particularly true over Canada, where drought is both a frequent and damaging phenomenon with impacts on regional water resources, agriculture, industry, aquatic ecosystems, and health. However, nationwide drought assessments are currently lacking and impacted by limited ground-based observations. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of historical droughts over the whole of Canada, including the role of large-scale teleconnections. Drought events are characterized by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) over various temporal scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 consecutive months, 6 months from April to September, and 12 months from October to September) applied to different gridded monthly data sets for the period 1950-2013. The Mann-Kendall test, rotated empirical orthogonal function, continuous wavelet transform, and wavelet coherence analyses are used, respectively, to investigate the trend, spatio-temporal patterns, periodicity, and teleconnectivity of drought events. Results indicate that southern (northern) parts of the country experienced significant trends towards drier (wetter) conditions although substantial variability exists. Two spatially well-defined regions with different temporal evolution of droughts were identified - the Canadian Prairies and northern central Canada. The analyses also revealed the presence of a dominant periodicity of between 8 and 32 months in the Prairie region and between 8 and 40 months in the northern central region. These cycles of low-frequency variability are found to be associated principally with the Pacific-North American (PNA) and Multivariate El Niño/Southern Oscillation Index (MEI) relative to other considered large-scale climate indices. This study is the first of its kind to identify dominant periodicities in drought variability over the whole of Canada in terms of when the drought events occur, their duration, and how often they occur. © Author(s) 2018.","Asong, Z.E.; Bonsal, B.; Kurkute, S.; Razavi, S.; Wheater, H.S.","","22",2018,"","","","","","","","","",""

Recognizing how this may affect the rate of lineage sorting among marker types is important for studies focused on resolving phylogenetic relationships among recently divergent taxa. In this study, we use gene tree, coalescent-based species tree, and isolation-with-migration analyses to explore the differences between marker types (autosomal, Z-linked, and mitochondrial) in resolving phylogenetic relationships among North American prairie grouse (Tympanuchus). We found that Z-linked loci were more likely to identify monophyletic relationships among prairie grouse species compared to autosomal and mtDNA loci in both species and gene tree analyses, with species tree analyses outperforming gene trees. These results were further supported with isolation-with-migration analyses, where Z-linked loci largely followed a strict isolation model while autosomal loci were more likely to fit a model with gene flow between species following population divergence. While accounting for differences in inheritance pattern (or Ne) for marker type, results suggest that additional factors, such as strong sexual selection and sex-biased introgression (i.e., male-biased postzygotic hybrid behavioral isolation or ""unsexy son""), may further explain the decreased diversity levels and increased rate of lineage sorting observed with the Z-linked loci relative to autosomal and mtDNA loci. In fact, to our knowledge no hybrid male prairie grouse have been observed breeding in the wild, yet hybrid females along with backcross females are known to produce viable offspring. Overall, this study highlights that more work is needed to determine how complex models of gene flow (i.e., sex biased introgression) and differences in the effective size among marker types based on differing life history strategies influence divergence date estimation and species delimitation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Galla, S.J.; Johnson, J.A.","","84",2015,"Effective population size; Hybridization; Mito-nuclear discordance; Sexual selection; Species tree; Z-chromosome","","","","","","","","",""

Species in these two genera can be distinguished only by the position of the spore relative to a precursor structure, the sporiferous saccule, as either within (entrophosporoid) or laterally (acaulosporoid) on the saccule subtending hypha. Subsequent spore differentiation follows identical patterns and organization. Molecular phylogeny reconstructed from nrLSU gene sequences, together with developmental data, support the hypothesis that the entrophosporoid mode of spore formation evolved many times and thus represents a convergent trait of little phylogenetic significance. Therefore genus Kuklospora is rejected as a valid monophyletic group and it is integrated taxonomically into genus Acaulospora. Thus Acaulospora colombiana and Acaulospora kentinensis are erected as new combinations (formerly Kuklospora colombiana and Kuklospora kentinensis). Mode of spore formation is demoted from a genus-specific character to one that is included with other traits to define Acaulospora species. In addition we describe a new AM fungal species, Acaulospora colliculosa (Acaulosporaceae), that originated from a tallgrass prairie in North America. Field-collected spores of A. colliculosa are small (<100 mm diam), hyaline or subhyaline to pale yellow and form via entrophosporoid development based on structure and organization of cicatrices and attached hyphae. Each spore consists of a bilayered spore wall and two bilayered inner walls. A germination orb likely forms after the completion of spore development to initiate germination, but this structure was not observed. A character distinguishing A. colliculosa from other Acaulospora species is hyaline to subhyaline hemispherical protuberances on the surface of the outer spore wall layer.

Mollic paleosols with deeper (some 1 m or more) calcic horizons represent tall grasslands and have not been found older than late Miocene.

To increase our knowledge of the soil factors that may contribute to its invasiveness, we conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment. Seed sources used were from an invasive population in northeastern California, USA and from a native population in southern France. Four soils were used: two from northeastern California, invaded (USI) and non-invaded (USN) by T. caput-medusae; two from southern France, with T. caput-medusae occupied (FR+) and a similar soil presently unoccupied (FR-) by T. caput-medusae. Treatments were control and autoclaved. Seeds were sown in containers (six replicates) for each soil and treatment combination of the reciprocal planting matrix and allowed to grow for 60 days. Following harvest, above-ground and below-ground tissue was dried and weight recorded separately. Above-ground tissue was analyzed for nutrient concentrations and various soil nutrient pools were quantified. Above-ground mass of T. caput-medusae was greatest in the USN soil and least in the FR- soil. Growth was affected by significant seed source x soil and treatment x soil interactions. French seed produced larger plants than did US seed when grown in the USN soil. For the USI soil, plant growth was significantly greater in the autoclaved soil than control. Availability of soil Fe, Mn, and ortho-P were significant predictors of plant growth as shown by stepwise regression. Moreover, the positive effect on growth of T. caput-medusae, due to autoclaving of USI soil, may be partially a consequence of elevated nutrient availability. Our data also suggests that US seed may have evolved a greater ability to uptake Mn from soil than French seed.

Ecological fitting, however, increases the probability of host switching, creating incongruences between host and parasite phylogenies, when (1) specialization on a particular host resource is a shared characteristic of distantly related parasites, and (2) the resource being tracked by the parasite is widespread among many host species. We investigated the effect of ecological fitting on structuring the platyhelminth communities of anurans from a temperate forest and grassland in the United States and tropical dry and wet forests in Mexico and Costa Rica. The six communities all exhibit similar structure in terms of the genera and families inhabiting the frogs. Parasite species richness is highly correlated with the amount of time a host spends in association with aquatic habitats, a conservative aspect of both parasite and host natural history, and determined in a proximal sense by host mobility and diet breadth. The pattern of parasite genera and families within host genera across the regions examined is consistent with the prediction that ecological fitting by phylogenetically conservative species, coupled with historical accidents of speciation and dispersal, should be evidenced as a nested-subset structure; the shared requirement for aquatic habitats of tadpoles provides a baseline assemblage to which other parasite taxa are added as a function of adult host association with aquatic habitats. We conclude that parasite communities are structured by both ecological fitting and coevolution (mutual modification), the relative influences of which are expected to vary among different communities and associations. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Brooks, D.R.; León-Régagnon, V.; McLennan, D.A.; Zelmer, D.","","87",2006,"Anurans; Coevolution; Community structure; Costa Rica; Ecological; Fitting; Frogs; Mexico; Nested subset; Parasitic platyhelminths; Phylogenetic conservatism; Toads; United States of America","","","","","","","","",""

Exotic plant invasions can reduce butterfly population size and growth by displacing key resources, degrading habitat conditions and directly impacting fitness, but exotic plants may also be incorporated into native butterfly diets, rendering practicing conservation biologists a choice between exotic plant control and butterfly population persistence. Euphydryas editha taylori (Nymphalidae), a candidate endangered butterfly species in the Pacific Northwest of North America, switched from an unknown native larval host plant to become entirely dependent on an exotic larval host Plantago lanceolata in extant western Oregon populations. Furthermore, the last Oregon butterfly populations are surrounded by two exotic grasses, Brachypodium sylvaticum and Festuca arundinacea , both of which can dominate remnant native prairies and degrade native grassland structural conditions. When given a choice of habitat conditions, E. e. taylori oviposited on larval host plants surrounded by increasing abundance of short-statured native bunchgrasses and adult nectar resources, indicating that females select egg-laying sites based on habitat conditions rather than just host plant presence. Both larval and adult resources substantially diminished with increasing cover of exotic grasses and were nearly absent when B. sylvaticum and F. arundinacea dominated. Butterfly resource loss with increasing exotic grass cover, the documentation of contemporary subpopulation extinction, current historic site conditions and grass invasion history in the Willamette Valley suggest that mass E. e. taylori extinction in western Oregon by the late 1970s was due to B. sylvaticum and F. arundinacea invasion. To prevent the extinction of E. e. taylori , land managers must accept that the anthropogenically mediated host switch to P. lanceolata must be conserved and that reintroductions/augmentation with a potential native host plant species is unlikely to be effective because larval development is timed to P. lanceolata growth. © Journal compilation © 2008 The Zoological Society of London.","Severns, P.M.; Warren, A.D.","","11",2008,"Brachypodium; Exotic species; Habitat quality; Habitat selection; Hostplant evolution; Microevolution","","","","","","","","",""

The carbon isotope compositions (δ13C relative to Vienna Peedee belemnite [VPDB]) of pedogenic carbonates from these sections record the protracted regional increase in the abundance of grasses using the C4 photosynthetic pathway over this interval, with the first appearance of a modern-like grassland ecosystem having &gt;70% C4 biomass around 1.3 Ma. We use the stable oxygen isotope composition (δ18O relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water [VSMOW]) of 194 paleosol carbonates from 19 measured sections to reconstruct the climatic conditions in the Meade Basin during the rise of C4 grasses to ecological dominance in the region. Pedogenic carbonate δ18O values are sensitive to soil temperature and the δ18O of soil water, and hence they are a paleoclimate proxy. Carbonate δ13C values do not exhibit consistent trends in relation to δ18O values, indicating no consistent relationship between short-term climatic conditions in terms of temperature or aridity and the abundance of C4 biomass. Mean carbonate δ18O values within biostratigraphic intervals decrease from the Clarendonian (25.3‰ ± 0.72‰) to the early and middle Blancan (21.8‰ ± 0.87‰ and 22.1‰ ± 0.69‰, respectively), and they also exhibit a decreasing trend in the late Blancan-early Irvingtonian, from ~25‰ to ~21‰. The increase in δ18O values between the end of the middle Blancan and the beginning of the late Blancan-early Irvingtonian sections could reflect the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and a change in the isotope composition of the hydrosphere due to increased ice volume. The long-term trend in δ18O values suggests that C4 biomass increased coincident with some combination of decreasing temperature, increasing proportion of winter precipitation recharge of soil water, and/or increasing soil moisture. Thus, the ecological dominance of C4 grasses in the region today does not seem to be linked to warmer temperatures or increased aridity. © 2012 Geological Society of America.","Fox, D.L.; Honey, J.G.; Martin, R.A.; Peláez-Campomanes, P.","","124",2012,"","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most accurate and useful ways to characterize vegetation, and therefore to describe the climatic and ecological conditions of a location, is through the plant fossil record. Phytoliths (plant silica microfossils) are often preserved in the absence of other paleobotanical data and are becoming more widely used for deep-time vegetation reconstructions. Significant work has been done to standardize the analytical methodology of phytolith extraction, statistical analysis, and interpretation, but more detailed investigations are needed to understand how well a given soil assemblage represents the actual aboveground plant biomass for a given ecosystem.We present results from paired soil phytolith assemblages and local vegetation assemblages across the central United States, including temperate forest, grassland, and rangeland/scrubland ecosystems. Phytolith assemblages obtained via extractions from soil A-horizons were compared to percent cover of species and plant biomass estimates obtained via in situ field observations and aerial estimates of tree cover to analyze differences in the relative abundance of forest/woody vegetation vs. grasses. Soil phytolith assemblages from all sites average a 29% bias toward the grass morphotypes as compared to actual aboveground biomass observations, and comparisons to percent cover yielded broadly comparable bias figures. Percent bias estimates do not show significant correlations to most environmental factors (temperature, precipitation, local elevation), however, an extremely strong correlation (p<0.001) was observed with soil order type. This is likely due to the fact that soil order reflects both vegetation type and chemical factors known to affect overall phytolith assemblages; therefore, soil order is a proxy that aggregates several sources of bias. As a result, we suggest further research into the development of correction factors between phytolith sample assemblages and their interpreted past counterpart ecosystems based on estimates derived from modern analyses of each major soil order type. Such background corrections are essential to the continued use of phytoliths as a proxy for past vegetation and ecological reconstructions of temperate ecosystems throughout the Phanerozoic record. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Hyland, E.; Sheldon, N.D.; Smith, S.Y.","","374",2013,"Paleosol; Phytolith; Soil; Taphonomy; Vegetation","","","","","","","","",""

Comparisons between black-footed ferrets and Siberian polecats, close relatives that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, allow the following evolutionary speculation. Predation on ferrets and polecats tends to narrow their niches and promote specialization due to requirements for escape habitats. In Asia, that influence is countered by the larger and more diverse area of steppe and alpine meadow habitats for polecats, and by plague which causes large variation in prey abundance.

Moreover, they can alter ecosystem processes and reduce biodiversity. In arid and semi-arid region of North America, the species of European annual grass Bromus tectorum L. is an outstanding example of these problems, which not only increase the fire density and change the fire regime, but replace native communities. Therefore, there are amount of researches on B. tectorum, including resource acquisition, water use efficiency and growth. Whereas the relevant research on the morphology of diaspore is scare. Diaspores have a fundamental role in seed germination and seedling establishment. Besides, as an important link between different generations, diaspores have a vital significance on individual reproduction and population extension. Hence, diaspores under selection for studying have an important implication. This study compares differences in seed morphology for Bromus tectorum collected from the United States, Kazakhstan, and Xinjiang of China. The following indices of B. tectorum diaspores were analyzed: size, thickness of covering layers, and micromorphological characteristics of the base, middle and transition area of diaspores as well as of the awn. Micromorphology of the lemma and the cross-section of the diaspore were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that thickness of the lemma and the palea of diaspores from B. tectorum-infested grasslands in the United States were reduced (P<0.05), likely because of environmental influences. This reduction facilitated the germination of diaspores and lowered the resistance of B. tectorum to adverse environmental conditions. The length of the awn also increased significantly (P<0.05), which helped in dispersal and anchoring of diaspores. Therefore, B. tectorum adapted ecologically to its new environment in the United States by strengthening its establishment ability. However, the defense capability of B. tectorum decreased. These results fit the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis (EICA) of invasive species. Analysis of various cells on the lemma revealed that prickle densities and collapsed, long epidermal cells were easily influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and moisture because of the physiologic function of these structures on silicon accumulation. However, the form and the position of silica cells, which were not greatly influenced by environmental factors, might be genetically controlled. Studying these structures at the microscopic level helps define the relationship between the diaspore and its environment.

Loss of big sagebrush and the decline of associated species, such as greater sage-grouse, are a concern to land managers and conservationists. However, big sagebrush regeneration remains difficult to achieve by restoration and reclamation efforts and there is no regeneration simulation model available. We present here the first process-based, daily time-step, simulation model to predict yearly big sagebrush regeneration including relevant germination and seedling responses to abiotic factors. We estimated values, uncertainty, and importance of 27 model parameters using a total of 1435 site-years of observation. Our model explained 74% of variability of number of years with successful regeneration at 46 sites. It also achieved 60% overall accuracy predicting yearly regeneration success/failure. Our results identify specific future research needed to improve our understanding of big sagebrush regeneration, including data at the subspecies level and improved parameter estimates for start of seed dispersal, modified wet thermal-time model of germination, and soil water potential influences. We found that relationships between big sagebrush regeneration and climate conditions were site specific, varying across the distribution of big sagebrush. This indicates that statistical models based on climate are unsuitable for understanding range-wide regeneration patterns or for assessing the potential consequences of changing climate on sagebrush regeneration and underscores the value of this process-based model. We used our model to predict potential regeneration across the range of sagebrush ecosystems in the western United States, which confirmed that seedling survival is a limiting factor, whereas germination is not. Our results also suggested that modeled regeneration suitability is necessary but not sufficient to explain sagebrush presence.

Clutch sizes (mean ± SE) were largest for teal (10.80 ± 0.03), followed in descending order by those of shoveler (10.31 ± 0.05), Gadwall (9.92 ± 0.04), Mallard (8.91 ± 0.04), and pintail (7.66 ± 0.06). In Mallard, pintail, and shoveler, predicted clutch sizes at onset of nesting exhibited minimal variation. Clutch sizes of Gadwall and teal displayed statistically significant variation among years at onset of nesting; pintail clutch sizes showed significant variation late in the nesting season. Clutch sizes declined seasonally in all species. Declines in clutch sizes of teal and shoveler were approximately linear; whereas clutch sizes of Mallard, pintail, and Gadwall usually declined at progressively decreasing rates. Linear declines in teal and shoveler clutches suggest that those species experienced greater difficulty securing lipids for egg production late in the nesting season than did Mallard, pintail, and Gadwall. That disparity may result because egg-laying female teal and shoveler feed almost exclusively on animal foods, which are primarily protein; whereas female Mallard, pintail, and Gadwall consume more carbohydrate-rich plant foods. Our findings, when examined in context with existing information, suggest that interspecific variation in clutch sizes results from innate differences in several traits-including body size, diet, timing of lipid acquisition, and nesting - all of which can affect the amount of lipid available for egg production. Temperate-nesting dabbling ducks have evolved traits that facilitate laying of large clutches early in the nesting season, because risk of mortality is lower among early-hatched young. Annual differences in clutch sizes of all five species were not significant when effects of annual variation in nest-initiation dates were accounted for, reflecting the key role of environmental influences on intraspecific variation in clutch sizes among years.","Krapu, G.L.; Renner, R.W.; Reynolds, R.E.; Sargeant, G.A.","","121",2004,"","","","","","","","","",""

As one of the most profound vegetation changes to occur in recent geologic time, it paved the way for modern tropical grassland ecosystems. Changes in CO2 levels, seasonality, aridity, herbivory, and fire regime have all been suggested as potential triggers for this broadly synchronous change, long after the evolutionary origin of the C4 pathway in grasses. To date, these hypotheses have suffered from a lack of direct evidence for floral composition and structure during this important transition. This study aimed to remedy the problem by providing the first direct, relatively continuous record of vegetation change for the Great Plains of North America for the critical interval (ca. 12-2 Ma) using plant silica (phytolith) assemblages. Phytoliths were extracted from late Miocene-Pliocene paleosols in Nebraska and Kansas. Quantitative phytolith analysis of the 14 best-preserved assemblages indicates that habitats varied substantially in openness during the middle to late Miocene but became more uniformly open, corresponding to relatively open grassland or savanna, during the late Miocene and early Pliocene. Phytolith data also point to a marked increase of grass short cells typical of chloridoid and other potentially C4 grasses of the PACMAD clade between 8 and 5 Ma; these data suggest that the proportion of these grasses reached up to ∼50-60% of grasses, resulting in mixed C 3-C4 and highly heterogeneous grassland communities by 5.5 Ma. This scenario is consistent with interpretations of isotopic records from paleosol carbonates and ungulate tooth enamel. The rise in abundance of chloridoids, which were present in the central Great Plains since the early Miocene, demonstrates that the ""globally"" observed lag between C 4 grass evolution/taxonomic diversification and ecological expansion occurred at the regional scale. These patterns of vegetation alteration imply that environmental change during the late Miocene-Pliocene played a major role in the C3-C4 shift in the Great Plains. Specifically, the importance of chloridoids as well as a decline in the relative abundance of forest indicator taxa, including palms, point to climatic drying as a key trigger for C4 dominance. © 2011 The Paleontological Society.

We measured competition intensity across gradients of species richness, evenness, and community composition, using pairs of naturally occurring plants of 12 species. One plant in each pair was isolated from neighbors to measure competition; community structure and environmental conditions were also measured at each pair. We used structural equation modeling to examine how competition influenced community structure. Competition intensity was unrelated to species richness and community composition, but increased competition intensity was associated with a slight decline in evenness. Size-symmetric root competition was probably unimportant in structuring this plant community because there are no feedback mechanisms through which size-symmetric competition can magnify small initial differences and eventually lead to competitive exclusion. In plant communities with little shoot competition, competition and community structure should be unlinked regardless of competition intensity. In more productive systems, we propose that interactions between root and shoot competition may indirectly structure communities by altering the overall asymmetry of competition. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

The Neogene mammalian biota maintains a relatively consistent trophic structure through most of the record, although taxonomic composition changes substantially through time.

Térapa, a unique fossil site located in the present-day desert of Northcentral Sonora, Mexico (29°41́N, 109°39́W, 605. m elevation), contributes to our understanding of the paleoecology and paleoclimate of the region during the Late Pleistocene, ca. 43,000-40,000. cal.yr BP. At least 60 vertebrate taxa, including amphibians, turtles, a crocodilian, snakes, birds and many mammals, have been recovered from an 11-m thick sequence of fossiliferous sediments. The diversity and tropical affinity of these taxa suggest a more-forested environment than the thornscrub desert habitat present in this region today.Isotopic analyses of tooth enamel carbonate from ancient mammalian herbivores suggest that the Sonoran desert has undergone considerable climate change since the Late Pleistocene. Bulk carbon (́13C) and oxygen (́18O) isotopes from nine mammalian fossils indicate a habitat mosaic with variations in diet that include browsers, mixed feeders and C4 hyper-grazers (́13C range of -10‰ to 2‰). Unique to this site are 13C tooth enamel values of -6.1 and -5.6 ‰ for the deer Odocoileus, which suggest a more variable diet than strict browsing, including possibly feeding on CAM and/or C4 plants. Serial sampling of carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopes for ancient mammal teeth with hypsodont dentitions (fossil Equus and Bison,) as well as δ18O meteroric water estimates from well-supported climatic models suggest a cooler and more equable environment at Térapa during the Late Pleistocene. These results also support previous habitat reconstructions inferred from the macrobotanical and packrat midden records of northern Sonora (Mexico). High-resolution stable isotope geochemistry indicates that: 1) ancient Térapa was covered with forest and grassland habitats that extended northward into Mexico by about 350km relative to their present-day northern limits during the Late Pleistocene; and 2) an Amount Effect (AE) is demonstrated in the fossil record at Térapa even though the climate was less seasonal compared to the modern desert habitat. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Baez, A.; Macfadden, B.J.; Mead, J.I.; Nunez, E.E.","","297",2010,"Deserts; Equable climate; Forests; Pleistocene; Sonora; Stable isotopes","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the carbon and oxygen isotope values (δ13C and δ18O) of tooth enamel carbonate and the δ13C values of fecal samples from modern feral horses. We compared those values with the δ13C values of local vegetation and the δ18O values of local waters. Herds were studied in two contrasting localities: eastern Oregon, where grasslands consisted of 100% C3 species, and New Mexico, where &gt;95% of the grasses were C4 species. Carbon isotope analyses of fecal material and tooth enamel suggest that horses consumed primarily grass, but some New Mexico horses also consumed significant amounts of shrubs and/or forbs. Microhistological analyses of fecal samples show that Oregon horses consumed 95% grass, and Oregon enamel δ13C values are consistent with a diet containing 100% C3 plants. Microhistological analyses of fecal samples from New Mexico indicate a diet averaging 75% grass, while enamel δ13C values suggest that diets averaged 85% C4 plants (range=72-97%). Thus, reconstructions of the C3/C4 ratio of grasses in ancient grasslands that are based on the δ 13C values of fossil equid teeth may underestimate the abundance of C4 grasses. The mean δ18O values of tooth enamel paralleled the trends observed in the mean δ18O values of precipitation. However, the mean δ18O values of enamel carbonate from Oregon and New Mexico differed by only 3.3‰, which is less than the difference in the mean δ18O values of precipitation (6.5‰). In addition, the range of δ18O values within New Mexico enamel samples (6.5‰) was greater than the difference between mean enamel δ18O values at each site. Calculated values for the δ18O of water ingested by horses are 2-3‰ more positive than mean δ18O values for corresponding precipitation, suggesting that horses consumed waters that were enriched in 18O due to evaporation. While our results confirm that local climatic and hydrological conditions can influence the δ 18O values of equid enamel, they also show that the δ 18O values of equid teeth are not always a direct proxy for the isotope ratios of precipitation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, some are species complexes and contain genetically distinct forms. Molecular analyses, together with morphological and biological methods, provide powerful means to dissect these complexes. Puccinia coronata is a complex species that has a broad telial host range including more than 45 genera of grasses and a narrow aecial host range. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA sequences from 15 aecial and telial collections grouped P. coronata into six distinct clades supporting separation of this complex into four distinct species. Puccinia andropogonis, a common rust of tall prairie grasses in North America, is also a complex species. However, in contrast to P. coronata, P. andropogonis has a narrow telial host range and a broad aecial host range. DNA sequence analysis grouped 15 collections of P. andropogonis into six distinct clades representing at least four distinct species.

Earliest members are recorded from the late Blancan Land Mammal age, Late Pliocene. The fossil history for Cynomys is well reconstructed for the Great Plains of the USA and Canada. However, it is insufficiently studied for the arid Southwest and almost entirely unknown for adjacent northern Mexico. This paper reports on the remains of Cynomys recovered from the paleontological site of La Playa, northern Sonora, Mexico. Two species of Cynomys live today in Mexico in disjunct, likely relictual locations, Cynomys ludovicianus and Cynomys mexicanus. The distribution of prairie dogs today does not include the region of La Playa: the closest population lives about 150 km north and east in northeastern-most Sonora and adjacent Arizona. The identification criteria presented here indicate that the black-tailed prairie dog, C. ludovicianus, inhabited the valley bottom now exposed as the La Playa fossil deposits. The description of this species from La Playa represents the first report of Rancholabrean prairie dogs from Sonora. Its recovery from the extremely low elevations of northern Sonora indicates that a different climatic regime was in operation during the Late Pleistocene resulting in local vegetation and soil types considerably different from those recorded there today.

Although the strength of these inhibitory effects, measured as soil feedbacks, has been assessed between natives and exotics in non-native ranges, few studies have compared the strength of plant-soil feedbacks for exotic species in soils from non-native versus native ranges. We examined whether 6 perennial European forb species that are widespread invaders in North American grasslands (Centaurea stoebe, Euphorbia esula, Hypericum perforatum, Linaria vulgaris, Potentilla recta and Leucanthemum vulgare) experienced different suppressive effects of soil biota collected from 21 sites across both ranges. Four of the six species tested exhibited substantially reduced shoot biomass in 'live' versus sterile soil from Europe. In contrast, North American soils produced no significant feedbacks on any of the invasive species tested indicating a broad scale escape from the inhibitory effects of soil biota. Negative feedbacks generated by European soil varied idiosyncratically among sites and species. Since this variation did not correspond with the presence of the target species at field sites, it suggests that negative feedbacks can be generated from soil biota that are widely distributed in native ranges in the absence of density-dependent effects. Synthesis. Our results show that for some invasives, native soils have strong suppressive potential, whereas this is not the case in soils from across the introduced range. Differences in regional-scale evolutionary history among plants and soil biota could ultimately help explain why some exotics are able to occur at higher abundance in the introduced versus native range.

Emphasis is on the spatial and morphological aspects of the mounds, and more particularly on the analysis of mound soils and gravel distributions as a means for shedding light on mound origins in this region. The results strongly suggest that hierarchically dominant point-centered bioturbation by small vertebrates is the mode of mound genesis. Pocket gophers (Geomys bursarius), aided by other biota, create mounds as they burrow in residual gravelly soils that have evolved dense, relatively impermeable claypans that perch water during wet periods. Although pocket gophers do not presently inhabit the Diamond Grove area, evidence of past occupation, along with laboratory and field data, support them as the dominant role in forming the mounds. We conclude that these mounds are expressions of point-centered and locally thickened biomantles.

Physiological attributes of C4 photosynthesis have been invoked to explain C4 grass biogeography; however, the pathway evolved exclusively in grass lineages of tropical origin, suggesting that the prevalence of C4 grasses in warm climates could be due to other traits inherited from their non-C4 ancestors. Here we investigate the relative influences of phylogeny and photosynthetic pathway in determining the ecological distributions of C4 grasses in Hawaii. We find that the restriction of C4 grasses to warmer areas is due largely to their evolutionary history as members of a warm-climate grass clade, but that the pathway does appear to confer a competitive advantage to grasses in more arid environments. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Edwards, E.J.; Still, C.J.","","11",2008,"Biogeography; C4 photosynthesis; Ecological sorting; Grassland; Photorespiration; Phylogenetic niche conservatism; Water use efficiency","","","","","","","","",""

The trip described here will examine in detail Quaternary strata and landscape evolution in arguably the most famous badlands, the White River Badlands of South Dakota, which were pivotal during development of vertebrate paleontology in North America. Geologists have collected fossils from the White River Group there nearly every field season since the mid-1800s; however, until recently, little work was reported on the extensively exposed Quaternary strata. The White River Badlands are also a proposed dust source for the widespread Peoria Loess of the Central Great Plains. The research highlighted on this trip includes (1) luminescence and radiocarbon ages from late Pleistocene through Holocene eolian sand, (2) radiocarbon ages from Holocene eolian cliff-top deposits, (3) luminescence ages from late Pleistocene fluvial silts, (4) radiocarbon ages of late Holocene fluvial silts, and (5) cosmogenic ages on ventifacts from the adjoining upper prairie. These new studies will facilitate discussions, including (1) late Quaternary paleoenvironments, (2) late Quaternary fluvial incision rates and episodes, (3) up-wind sediment supply of late Quaternary nonglaciogenic loess, (4) landscape evolution spanning late Pleistocene tableland through late Holocene sod table development, and (5) modern erosion-pedimentation rates. © 2007 The Geological Society of America.

Phytolith assemblage analysis is widely employed for reconstructing vegetation types in Pleistocene-Holocene paleoecology and archaeology, but no standardized methodology is currently available. Published phytolith studies are often system-specific and tailored after specific modern analogues. As a result, they vary in extraction technique, classification scheme, and method of inference. For ancient phytolith assemblages whose modern analogues are not well understood, a more general analytic approach is necessary. This analytic approach includes studying all size fractions (2-250 mm), using a classification scheme based on the available literature and a comprehensive modern phytolith reference collection, and comparing relative frequencies through time of all diagnostic phytoliths to interpret changes in habitat structure. This general method was applied to late Eocene to early Miocene sediment samples from northwestern Nebraska to deduce vegetation history and the results were compared to those obtained using a more specific technique [Strömberg, Paleogeogr. Paleoclimatol. Paleoecol. 177 (2002) 59]. In both studies, phytoliths were extracted by means of heavy liquid separation from the following lithostratigraphic units: (1) the late Eocene Chadron Formation and the early Oligocene Brule Formation (White River Group); (2) the late Oligocene-early Miocene Monroe Creek Formation, the early Miocene Harrison Formation and Anderson Ranch Formation (Arikaree Group); and (3) the early Miocene Runningwater Formation and Box Butte Formation (Ogallala Group). The two techniques, general vs. specific, produced results that differ markedly. Data from the general approach indicate the presence of relatively closed habitats in late Eocene to early Oligocene, typified by the presence of phytoliths from bambusoid grasses, woody and herbaceous dicotyledons, and palms. The introduction and spread of modern, open-habitat grasses, such as pooids, arundinoids, and panicoids, occurred between the late Oligocene and early Miocene. This resulted in a savanna or woodland type habitat by the early Miocene. In contrast, analysis using the specific method suggested the presence of open habitats in northwestern Nebraska from the late Eocene onward. The difference in interpretation based on the two approaches is principally due to inclusion of phytoliths >50 mm and the use of an expanded reference collection in the current study (general analytic approach). These results point to the importance of methodological choices in phytolith analysis and emphasize the usefulness of phytoliths as paleoecological indicators in the fossil record. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

New species or entire lineages of commensal insects have evolved in response to these new microhabitats, and the hyperdiverse rove beetles (Staphylinidae) are no exception. A well-known assemblage of commensal rove beetles in Central Europe is closely associated with the nests and burrows of mammals and birds. Despite similar temperate biomes and an even greater diversity of suitable host vertebrates in the Nearctic region, this fauna remains poorly known, and its documentation is scattered in collections and the primary literature. This review provides an overview of the rove beetles putatively specialized for life in burrows and nests. A total of 46 species from 7 of the 25 Nearctic subfamilies are known thus far, with most in the Aleocharinae and Staphylininae. Hosts for Nearctic Staphylinidae include groundhog, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, pocket gophers, mountain beaver, gopher tortoise, woodrats, North American beaver and muskrat, and several species of birds. Numerous potential vertebrate hosts remain overlooked, and most known hosts are rarely sampled and then only within a small portion of their distribution.

The degree to which population trends differed between grassland and shrub habitats was evaluated with respect to migratory and nesting behavior. Grassland birds declined significantly between 1980 and 1999, but, on average, shrub habitat species did not. Grassland-breeding, long-distance migrants exhibited the strongest negative trends. Most species (78%; n = 63) exhibited at least one significant association between population trends and changes in agricultural land use, and in most, land use ""explained"" 25-30% of the variation in population trends among states. Changes in the farmland landscape accounted for more of the interstate variability of population trends of short-distance migrants than of both long-distance migrants and residents, and that variability was greater in grassland than shrub species. Declines in the area of rangeland and cover crops were followed by population declines and increases, respectively, by many species. Increases of land in the Conservation Reserve Program had negative associations with population trends of some shrub species. The results indicate that grassland birds have declined strongly over the past two decades, and that regardless of migratory behavior or nesting habits, avian population trends are linked strongly to changes in agricultural land use within North America.","Murphy, M.T.","","120",2003,"","","","","","","","","",""

Geochemical data indicate that the Abilene dune sand is immature and was derived from the underlying Pleistocene alluvium, and not from Holocene age Smoky Hill River deposits. These findings suggest that dune activation was a response to increased aridity and local reduction in vegetation cover as opposed to changes in sediment availability from nearby rivers. The time interval of dune activation at Abilene overlaps Medieval Warm Period megadroughts, similar to the larger and more westerly dune fields on the Great Plains, including the Nebraska Sand Hills and the Great Bend Sand Prairie. The activation of smaller dune fields such as the Abilene dunes near the more humid eastern margin of the Great Plains shows the geographic extent and severity of paleodrought events. Unlike the Duncan dunes, another plains-marginal dune field, however, the Abilene dunes show no evidence for multiple drought events during the Holocene. This difference in dune activity, if it is not a result of sampling or preservation bias, indicates variations in the extent and severity of older drought events at the eastern margin of the Great Plains.","Arbogast, A.F.; Hanson, P.R.; Joeckel, R.M.; Johnson, W.C.; Young, A.R.","","1",2010,"Drought; Dunes; Great Plains; Kansas; Optical dating","","","","","","","","",""

Two aspects are emphasized: (1) the number of species within each guild and (2) the extent of locomotor convergence as inferred from morphology among the constituent species. Locomotor behavior reflects habitat choice, hunting mode, and escape strategy, all of which appear to be important avenues of adaptive divergence among coexisting predators. Locomotor behavior in extinct and extant predators is determined from body weight and five measured characteristics of the postcranial skeleton, including ungual shape, elbow shape, and limb proportions. Results indicate that levels of morphologic and inferred ecologic similarity between large predators are higher in the tropical grassland guild of East Africa than in the equivalent guilds of either tropical or temperate forest. This may be due to the great density and diversity of terrestrial herbivores in the productive grasslands. The fossil guild, from the Late Chadron-Orellan (Oligocene) of North America, appears most similar to the tropical forest guilds, but the predators seem to have been slower and more robust than their modern counterparts. Since the Orellan represents an early stage in the evolution of large, fissiped carnivores, both ancestry and time could have influenced Orellan guild structure. © 1985, Paleontological Society.

The Lilienthal local biota, dating between 5920 ± 60 and 6300 ± 80 14C B.P., is a rare exception as the site contains all three proxies juxtaposed in alluvium, impounded upstream from a fossil log near the headwaters of Mud Creek, east-central Iowa, U.S.A.

This paper compares the taphonomic framework for each fossil group, interprets the paleoecologic signal from each, and then compares the three interpretations. Pollen and plant macrofossils are found in organic silts, indicating deposition in a quiet water environment. Microvertebrates ordinarily occur in sand-sized sediments and show evidence of fluvial transport. Despite these different pathways, all Lilienthal assemblages indicate that a largely closed mesic deciduous forest grew along Mud Creek in mid-Holocene time. Therefore, a narrow north-south ecotone must have existed between the forest and tall-grass prairie biomes in eastern Iowa.

Drier climate of late Oligocene time also may explain changes in the clay mineral assemblages, as well as changes in hue from red to brown and then yellow. Climatic deterioration across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary is prominently displayed in the appearance of these colourfully banded badlands. The paleosols contain abundant drab-haloed root traces and their profile form and soil structures also are evidence of changing vegetation: moist forests giving way to dry forests, to wooded grassland, and eventually to large areas of open grassland by 30 Ma.

The coniferous forest, oak-juniper woodland of the early Holocene changed to desert-grassland about 8250 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP), with a corresponding shift in ant species composition. By about 7500 yr BP, the presence of several arid adapted species suggests the establishment of desert environments. Finally after about 2500 yr BP, we see the occurrence of primarily desert adapted ant species in the Chihuahuan Desert, although mesic adapted species continue to occur in moist “islands” within the area.

This review suggests that former disturbances, which are now often lost, may have once kept tall vegetation from pushing out rarer subdominant species. In cases where prehistoric biodiversity depended on fire or large ungulate grazing, traditional agricultural and indigenous practices may have carried biodiversity forward to historical times by mimicking pre-cultural disturbances (e.g., lightning fire and bison grazing). Ironically, biodiversity related to species richness, landscape heterogeneity and function may decline in preserves, especially if traditional management once maintained this biodiversity.

We assert that mesquite expansion may have ultimately occurred in the absence of widespread livestock grazing during the last 130 years because of removal of barriers to mesquite expansion created by indigenous peoples. We explore factors that attenuate or intensify mesquite expansion, and examine how a series of fine scale, but temporally seminal, events can propagate across multiple scales.

These grasslands are characterized by dominance of C 4 perennial grasses (particularly Schizachyrium scoparium) and are distributed in eastern United States from Missouri and Pennsylvania south to Arkansas and Georgia. XLPs occur in the Ozark Plateaus, Central Lowland, Interior Low Plateaus, Appalachian Plateaus, Ridge and Valley, and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces, and they are developed on Alfisols, Ultisols, Mollisols, Inceptisols, and Vertisols derived from Paleozoic limestones (also Eocene), dolomites, and calcareous shales. The C4 perennial prairie grass S. scoparium is the characteristic dominant taxon in XLPs of eastern United States. However, C3 perennial forbs are dominant in some sites, and C 4 annual grasses (Sporobolus spp.) may be locally dominant in shallow-soil-zone microsites. Thirteen taxa apparently are endemic, or nearly so, to this vegetation type, including eight in the Ridge and Valley in Alabama (Cahaba River valley), four in the Ozark Plateaus in Missouri and Arkansas, and one in the Ridge and Valley of West Virginia and Virginia. Various types of information are used to construct a conceptual model of the origin, maintenance, and successional dynamics of XLPs.

Optical ages document the timing of valley-infilling by sand dunes in the Qu'Appelle River area, and of cliff-top eolian deposition along the South Saskatchewan River. These ages, along with published radiocarbon and optical ages, are used to develop a chronology of eolian activity for south-central Saskatchewan. Optical ages of eolian sands ranging from 5.7 to 0.14 ka (before AD 2000), with intervening paleosols, indicate alternating periods of eolian activity and dune stability during the late Holocene, supported by published radiocarbon ages. Other published radiocarbon ages ranging from 11.3 to 8.4 cal ka BP indicate early Holocene eolian activity. Mid-Holocene ages are predominantly absent from the chronology and this is interpreted as being due to extensive eolian reworking during at least the latter part of the mid-Holocene. The chronology in south-central Saskatchewan is similar to other parts of the southern Canadian prairies. It is likely that preserved mid-Holocene eolian deposits occur within depositional basins in the southern Canadian prairies, and at sites near the southern boreal forest boundary with the prairie ecozone.","Lian, O.B.; Ollerhead, J.; Wolfe, S.A.","","56",2002,"","","","","","","","","",""

Discontinuous variation between geographically adjacent populations suggests the presence of a significant barrier to gene flow. Here I present genetic evidence for restricted gene flow between migratory and nonmigratory populations of prairie warblers. The nonmigratory form of this species is restricted to coastal mangroves in Florida and is morphologically distinguishable from the typical, migratory form that occurs across the remainder of the eastern United States. Pairs of migratory populations exhibited little population subdivision (Φ(ST) ≤ 0.09), whereas pairs of migratory and nonmigratory populations are much more differentiated (Φ(ST) = 0.27 0.42). A phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes did not offer evidence of long-term isolation of migratory and nonmigratory populations. Together with the population genetic analysis, the phylogenetic relationship of haplotypes suggests that isolation between these forms must have arisen relatively recently in their history. Evidence for significant population structure is unexpected, given the geographic proximity of migratory and nonmigratory populations, the capacity for long-distance movements (e.g., migration) by prairie warblers, and several previous studies of population structure in North American birds. However, the findings are consistent with the geographic distribution of morphological and behavioral variation and demonstrate that significant boundaries between populations of vagile organisms may be relatively cryptic.","Buerkle, C.A.","","53",1999,"AMOVA; Dendroica; Geographic variation; Phylogeography; Population differentiation; mtDNA","","","","","","","","",""

The distribution of fungal infection in natural plant populations is unknown for many host species. We investigated the occurrence of endophytic fungi in Elymus canadensis L.

To demonstrate the utility of DNA sequence data for species-level phylogenetic studies of Cicadellidae, we estimated phylogenetic relationships among species in the North American grassland leafhopper genusFlexamiaDeLong using partial nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial 16S rDNA and NADH dehydrogenase 1, totaling 1496 base pairs and 810 potentially informative characters.

The reconstructions indicate relatively high flows during the 20th Century and provide evidence of past prolonged droughts. Low flows during the 1840s correspond with aridity that extended over much of the western United States. Similarly, an exceptional period of prolonged low flow conditions, approximately 900 A.D. to 1300 A.D., is coincident with evidence of sustained drought across central and western North America. The 16th Century megadrought of the western United States and Mexico, however, does not appear to have had a major impact on the Canadian rivers.

Here, we test whether a highly productive grass, Agropyron cristatum (L.)

We grew individuals of A. cristatum from six seeded populations and 12 invading populations in 12 common gardens separated by 0.5-12 km for two growing seasons. Contrary to expectations, individuals from invading populations did not have significantly greater tiller number or growth (increase in tiller number) than did individuals from seeded populations, suggesting that they have not undergone evolution towards increased invasion ability through increased size or growth. Instead, there was a general trend for individuals from invading populations to have lower growth rates and fewer tillers when grown without neighbours. Large size or high growth rates arising from artificial selection prior to introduction may be disadvantageous to populations invading semiarid grassland on dry, nutrient-poor soils.

The oxygen-isotope compositions of both cellulose and silica record a complex signal of the isotopic composition of the soil water that feeds the plants and the relative humidity conditions that influence transpiration rates, stomatal conductance, and ultimately the 18O-enrichment of leaf water. As the initial stages of cellulose formation occur in the leaves, cellulose in both the leaves and stems forms primarily from leaf water and does not differ greatly in its oxygen-isotope composition between these locations. In contrast, the δ18O values of leaf phytoliths are significantly enriched in 18O relative to stem phytoliths, reflecting the varying isotopic composition of the water in these tissues. The oxygen-isotope compositions of leaf cellulose may be used as a proxy for the isotopic composition of water involved in leaf phytolith formation, while the δ18O values of stem phytoliths can be used to determine the δ18O values of stem water involved in partial exchange reactions during the transport of carbohydrates through the plant. A comparison of the isotopic compositions of phytoliths with cellulose allows for the deduction of soil and leaf water δ18O values as well as temperature and relative humidity conditions during plant growth.

Differences in CO2 evolution from the treatment with the lowest SOM on a site and that of other treatments (δCO2 -C) in the early stages of the incubation were correlated to δPOM-C and this pool reflects short-term SOC storage.

This magnetochronology provides considerably more robust ages for three associated land mammalian faunal assemblages. Updated ages end the debate on existing ambiguous and distinctly different magnetostratigraphic correlations for those Late Oligocene-Early Miocene assemblages. The new ages now enable precise correlation of these faunas to the European Land Mammal and North American Land Mammal Ages. The faunal assemblages further suggest a mixed setting of woodlands and grasslands associated with a humid environment in the Lanzhou Basin during the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene, in contrast to its modern poor vegetation cover and arid environment. © The Author(s) 2016.","An, Z.; Ao, H.; Dekkers, M.J.; Li, Y.; Zhang, P.","","6",2016,"","","","","","","","","",""

Three described tumbleweed species and two undescribed Salsola taxa occur in California. The known species are Russian thistle, Salsola tragus, introduced from Eurasia in the 1800s, Russian barbwire thistle, S. paulsenii, which grows in the desert regions of California, and is also native to Eurasia, and the recently identified S. kali subspecies austroafricana, possibly native to South Africa. Our goals were to investigate karyology, genome size, and molecular genetic affinities of the described species and the other taxa within their ranges in California using recently developed microsatellite loci, dominant nuclear DNA markers (RAPD and ISSR), and DNA sequence data. Chromosome counts and genome size assessments made with flow cytometry were compared. These analyses indicated that one undescribed taxon is a new allopolyploid hybrid between S. tragus and S. kali subspecies austroafricana, and the other undescribed taxon appears to be a complex hybrid involving all three described species. The invasion potentials for the hybrid taxa are unknown.

This study investigates the environmental sensitivity of dairy cattle genotypes (or breeds), in relation to the range of herd milksolid yields (a proxy for feeding level) in New Zealand. Genetic variation in environmental sensitivity was observed with overseas Holstein Friesian genotypes, originating largely from North America, exhibiting higher environmental sensitivity levels and environmental optimums than New Zealand Friesian and Jersey genotypes in a range of feeding level environments. Overseas Holstein Friesian genotypes were more likely to be considered specialists (i.e., perform to high levels in superior feeding level environments), whereas New Zealand Friesian and Jersey genotypes were largely generalists (i.e., tolerant to changes in environment), or specialists in a grassland-type environment. This confirmed the theory that generalist genotypes evolve in heterogeneous environments, whereas specialist genotypes evolve in homogeneous environments. However, variations in environmental sensitivity within genotypes did exist. Generalist genotypes appear to be indirectly selected in New Zealand as environmental sensitivity levels are decreasing.

Global expansion of C4 biomass is recorded in the diets of mammals from Asia, Africa, North America, and South America during the interval from about 8 to 5 Ma. This was accompanied by the most significant Cenozoic faunal turnover on each of these continents, indicating that ecological changes at this time were an important factor in mammalian extinction. Further expansion of tropical C4 biomass in Africa also occurred during the last glacial interval confirming the link between atmospheric CO2 levels and C4 biomass response. Changes in fauna and flora at the end of the Miocene, and between the last glacial and interglacial, have previously been attributed to changes in aridity; however, an alternative explanation for a global expansion of C4 biomass is CO2 starvation of C3 plants when atmospheric CO2 levels dropped below a threshold significant to C3 plants. Aridity may also have been a factor in the expansion of C4 ecosystems but one that was secondary to, and perhaps because of, gradually decreasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Mammalian evolution in the late Neogene, then, may be related to the CO2 starvation of C3 ecosystems.","Cerling, T.E.","","353",1998,"CO2; Carbon isotopes; Evolution; Grassland; Neogene","","","","","","","","",""

The region remains mostly intact but is expected to undergo major changes over the next century due to anthropogenic climate change. This warming, and resulting changes in moisture regimes, are altering vegetation and disturbance dynamics, and will likely result in expansion of grasslands and deciduous forests, strongly challenging bird species to keep pace. We present a vulnerability-adaptation framework to guide bird conservation based on species’ individual vulnerability and exposure to climate change. For sensitive species with declining populations, conservation should focus on management of current threats and species recovery in situ to improve adaptive capacity and facilitate future shifts in distribution. Sensitive species with high exposure to climate change may warrant more extensive intervention, such as habitat manipulation or even translocation. For species with lower sensitivity and stable populations, but high climate change exposure, longterm investments in protecting refugia and “stepping stones” will be most effective. In general, across all species, land-based approaches that “conserve nature’s stage” by promoting geophysical diversity and habitat connectivity, maintaining natural disturbance dynamics, and facilitating broad shifts in bird distribution may prove most effective in maintaining species diversity. Implementation of this framework will require large-scale, interagency coordination on recovery plans, as well as adaptive forest management, designation of critical habitat, and land protection. Challenges include data gaps, uncertainty about future conditions, coordination of conservation actions during the nonbreeding periods, and the region’s vast scale. However, given the region’s continental importance, successful implementation of this framework could benefit birds throughout the western hemisphere. © 2019 by the author(s).","Berteaux, D.; Drever, C.R.; Drever, M.; Lewis, I.N.; Schmiegelow, F.K.A.; Stralberg, D.; Tremblay, J.A.","","14",2019,"","","","","","","","","",""

Potential drivers of extinction include the expansion of C4 grasslands, cooling climate, and increased seasonality. Here we examine potential changes in the relative abundance of two common genera, Aphelops and Teleoceras, from the middle Miocene to the Pliocene of the Great Plains. We also use stable isotopes in tooth enamel to test whether Great Plains rhinoceroses were able to incorporate C4 vegetation into their diet after the expansion of C4 grasslands. Relative abundance of rhinoceroses fluctuates during the middle to late Miocene but then rapidly declines at the end of the Miocene around 6.5 Ma, coinciding with the expansion of C4 grasslands on the Great Plains. Stable carbon isotopes indicate that both Aphelops and Teleoceras were predominantly C3 feeders for most of their history. During C4 expansion some individuals were able to adapt to modest C4 consumption but were not as successful as contemporaneous horses. Our results suggest that the extinction of rhinoceroses was associated with environmental stress related to diminishing food resources following the expansion of C4 vegetation, possibly coupled with a shorter growing season as climate cooled. In addition, tooth enamel δ18O values in rhinoceroses do not support the interpretation that Teleoceras, a “hippo-ecomorph”, had a semi-aquatic lifestyle. Tooth enamel δ18O values reflect a strong latitudinal temperature gradient, suggesting that rhinoceroses effectively track δ18O values in surface waters and are potentially useful for paleoclimatic reconstructions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Secord, R.; Wang, B.","","542",2020,"C4 expansion; Diet; Miocene; Rhinocerotidae; Stable isotopes; Ungulate","","","","","","","","",""

Community dispersion may increase or decrease (representing a divergence or convergence among communities) if changing environmental conditions alter species interactions or magnify small initial differences that develop during community assembly. We used data from an experimental study of disturbance and fertilization in a low-productivity grassland to test how these two perturbations affect patterns of species composition and abundance. We found that a one-time biomass reduction decreased community dispersion, which persisted over four growing seasons. Conversely, continuous fertilization increased community dispersion and,when combined with disturbance, led to the formation of three distinct community states. These results illustrate that perturbations can have differing effects on community dispersion. Attention to the variance in community responses to perturbations lends insight into how ecological interactions determine community structure, which may be missed when focusing only on mean responses.

Dental shape variation primarily reflects relative size of P3 (upper cheek teeth) and relative width of p4-ml + length of m3 (lower cheek teeth). Shape variables and relative tooth crown height covary significantly across species, suggesting a common functional complex or shared genetic control. When dental morphology is mapped on published DNA-based phytogenies, Sciurotamias (Chinese rock squirrels), Ammospermophilus (antelope squirrels), and basal subgenera within Spermophilus (ground squirrels [Callospermophilus and Otospermophilus]) are shown to retain inferred primitive dental morphology- small to moderate dental size, relatively small P3, relatively narrow p4-ml + shortened m3, and relatively low toothcrown height.

Such studies require that the isotopic composition of precipitation be known. Oxygen-18 (δ 18O) and deuterium (δ2H) data for precipitation are lacking in the semi-arid portion of the north-central U.S. Great Plains, and thus there is a need to establish additional meteoric water lines as isotope input functions across the region, as well as to develop better understanding of the isotopic climate linkages that control oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios in precipitation.

Streams of this region already have some of the hottest free-flowing water on earth (summer maxima of 38–40°C), and even now fish live at times very near their lethal thermal limits. Unlike many terrestrial and marine organisms or fishes of some rivers, fishes in these prairie stream systems cannot migrate northward to cooler temperatures in the event of global warming. If warming of 3–4°C occurs, a substantial number of species endemic to this region could face extinction unless they adapt behaviorally or genetically for thermal increases. Existing evidence suggests little likelihood of successful behavioral adjustments. Data on thermal tolerance of local populations provide conflicting evidence: one widespread species of the Great Plains shows no difference in thermal tolerance across its range, whereas another shows adaptation to environmental temperatures at the local level. Because of the evolutionarily brief time predicted for global warming, it is unlikely that genetic options can arise rapidly enough through mutation to allow species to cope with hotter environments. Species that survive major increases in environmental temperature will likely be ones with adequate existing genetic variation to allow survival and selection of at least some individuals.

Faunas from these sections document the evolution of the small mammal community of the modern grassland ecosystem of the region, and the stable isotope composition of paleosol carbonates provides a means by which the environmental context of the evolution of the modern ecosystem may be documented. We used the stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C relative to Vienna Peedee belemnite [VPDB]) of 194 pedogenic carbonates from 19 measured sections to reconstruct the history of C4 grass abundance in the Meade Basin. Paleosol carbonate δ13C values reflect the proportion of C3 (trees, shrubs, cool- climate grasses) and C4 (warm-climate grasses) plants that grew in an ancient soil and provide a means with which to reconstruct past mammalian habitats. Paleosol carbonate δ13C values record a three-phase increase in the abundance of C4 biomass during the Neogene in the Meade Basin. Late Miocene sections have mean δ13C values of -7.6‰ ± 0.90‰ (Clarendonian) and -6.5‰ ± 0.31‰ (Hemphillian NALMA, 9.0-4.9 Ma), consistent with 17% and 26% C4 biomass, respectively. Miocene δ13C values from Meade are statistically identical to published δ13C values for Miocene paleosol carbonates elsewhere in the southern Great Plains, supporting the widespread presence of ~20% C4 biomass on average in the region throughout the Miocene. The abundance of C4 biomass increased between the end of the Hemphillian section and the beginning of the early Blancan NALMA (5.0-3.0 Ma). Early and middle Blancan (3.0-2.5 Ma) carbonates have statistically identical δ13C values (-4.9‰ ± 0.90‰ and -5.0‰ ± 1.10‰, respectively), suggesting a stable ecosystem during the early Pliocene, although high δ13C variability in densely sampled intervals suggests a high degree of landscape-scale variation in C4 abundance. The final phase, geochronologically controlled by two well- characterized ashes (Huckleberry Ridge, 2.10 Ma; Cerro Toledo B, 1.47-1.23 Ma) and magnetostratigraphy, is a trend to higher δ13C values from the late Blancan to early Irvingtonian (ca. 2.5-ca 1.0 Ma) from -4‰ at the base of the section to ~1‰ at the top, corresponding to an increase from almost 50% to 65% C4 biomass. The abundance of C4 biomass first reaches modern levels for the region (78% ± 10.9%) around the level of the Cerro Toledo B ash, indicating that a modern-like grassland ecosystem first appeared in the region ca. 1.3 Ma, although δ13C values do not remain consistently high through the rest of the section. © 2012 Geological Society of America.","Fox, D.L.; Honey, J.G.; Martin, R.A.; Peláez-Campomanes, P.","","124",2012,"","","","","","","","","",""

We use isotopic data and couple climate and vegetation models to assess the balance between C 3 and C4 vegetation in Texas during this period. The carbon isotope composition of fossil bison, mammoth, and horse tooth enamel is used as a proxy for C3 versus C4 plant consumption, and indicates that C4 plant biomass remained above 55% through most of Texas from prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) into the Holocene. These data also reveal that horses did not feed exclusively on herbaceous plants, consequently isotopic data from horses are not reliable indicators of the C 3-C4 balance in grassland biomes. Estimates of C 4 percentages from coupled climate-vegetation models illuminate the relative roles of climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in shaping the regional C4 signal. C4 percentages estimated using observed modern climate-vegetation relationships and late Quaternary climate variables (simulated by a global climate model) are much lower than those indicated by carbon isotope values from fossils. When the effect of atmospheric CO2 concentration on the competitive balance between C3 and C4 plants is included in the numerical experiment, however, estimated C4 percentages show better agreement with isotopic estimates from late Quaternary mammals and soils.

This complex pathway, involving novel patterns of biochemical compartmentation and anatomical design, has evolved with independent but convergent patterns approximately fifty times during the relatively short geological span of 12–15 million years (Kellogg, 1999; Monson, 1999; Sage, 2004; Christin et al., 2007). The appearance of C4photosynthesis has changed the nature of photosynthetic productivity and ecosystem structure on Earth, both regionally and globally. Grassland ecosystems emerged in southwestern Asia, Africa and North America during the mid- to late-Miocene (5–10 Ma) and continued through the Pliocene, (~3Ma), with many of these systems dominated by C4species (Cerling, 1999; Beerling and Osborne, 2006). During the appearance of C4 grasslands, the trophic structures of grazed ecosystems were completely revised, resulting in the emergence of novel mammalian lineages (Cerling et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1994; MacFadden and Cerling, 1996; Ehleringer et al., 1997). Arguably, there is not a better example in the history of life to illustrate the tightly integrated nature of evolutionary novelty and ecological impact, as that shown in C4 photosynthesis. Clearly, C4 photosynthesis, though present in only 8,000 of the estimated 250,000 higher plant species, deserves a significant role in the discussion of plant biology. © Cambridge University Press 2012.","Collatz, G.J.; Monson, R.K.","","",2011,"","","","","","","","","",""

Paleobotanical, paleofaunal, and stable carbon isotope records suggest five major phases in the origin of grass-dominated ecosystems: (1) the late Maastrichtian (or Paleocene) origin of Poaceae; (2) the opening of Paleocene and Eocene forested environments in the early to middle Tertiary; (3) an increase in the abundance of C3 grasses during the middle Tertiary; (4) the origin of C4 grasses in the middle Miocene; and (5) the spread of C4 grass-dominated ecosystems at the expense of C3 vegetation in the late Miocene. Grasses are known from all continents except Antarctica between the early Paleocene and middle Eocene. Herbivore morphology indicative of grazing, and therefore suggestive of grass-dominated ecosystems, appears in South America by the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, prior to the occurrence of grazing morphology elsewhere, and persists throughout the Cenozoic. Clear vertebrate and paleobotanical evidence of widespread grass-dominated ecosystems in northern continents does not occur until the early to middle Miocene. C4 grasses are present from approximately 15 Ma and undergo a dramatic expansion in the lower latitudes of North America, South America, East Africa, and Pakistan between 9 and 4 Ma. The expansion may have taken place in a shorter interval in some regions. C4 grasses are characteristic of seasonal, arid, and warm environments and are more tolerant of lower atmospheric CO2 (&lt; 400 ppmv) than C3 plants. C4 grass distribution, therefore, is climatically controlled. The late Miocene spread of Ca grasses possibly involved a decrease in atmospheric CO2 and heralded the establishment of modern seasonality and rainfall patterns.","Jacobs, B.F.; Jacobs, L.L.; Kingston, J.D.","","86",1999,"","","","","","","","","",""

Horses and gomphotheres were 2 very conspicuous groups of immigrant mammals from North America that arrived in South America during the Pleistocene. The present study compiles updated data on the phylogeny, systematics and ecology of both groups in South America. The horses in South America are represented by 2 genera, Hippidion and Equus, as are the gomphotheres, represented by Cuvieronius and Stegomastodon. Both genera of horses include small (Hippidion devillei, H. saldiasi, E. andium and E. insulatus) and large forms (Equus neogeus and H. principale), which dispersed into South America using 2 different routes. The possible model for this dispersion indicates that the small forms used the Andes corridor, while larger horses dispersed through the eastern route and through some coastal areas. In the case of gomphotheres, Cuvieronius and Stegomastodon reached South America in 2 independent dispersal events, and Cuvieronius dispersed across the Andean corridor, while large Stegomastodon spread along the eastern route. Horses and gomphotheres present values of δ13C from woodlands to C4 grasslands. Hippidion present lower values of δ13C than Equus in the late Pleistocene, whereas the gomphotheres diverge from value of δ18O, reflecting that Cuvieronius inhabited the Andean corridor and Stegomastodon dispersed through eastern plains.

While there are a variety of opinions concerning differences between these two species, there is a lack of scientific comparisons, including those that incorporate important ecological variation. We developed a framework to study and compare the grazing behavior and effects of bison and cattle within grassland ecosystems. Environmental (e.g., resource distribution, disturbance) and animal (e.g., number, social organization) factors play a critical role in determining grazing effects and should be incorporated into discussions that compare the effects of bison and cattle. Using this framework we specifically compare the grazing behavior of both species in tallgrass prairie and discuss the implications of these differences in the context of conservation. We collared bison and cattle with global positioning systems and used resource selection functions to estimate the importance of various environmental factors on site selection. Both species preferred recently burned areas and avoided steeper slopes. Cattle selected areas that were closer to water, while bison were not limited by distance to water; cattle also preferred areas with woody vegetation, while bison avoided them. Incorporating broad scale environmental complexity allows for an effective comparison of ecological differences between bison and cattle. While there are similarities and differences in these species, a comprehensive analysis of all conditions and scenarios is not possible. It is clear, however, that the greatest differences between these species will likely be evident from broad scale studies across complex landscapes. In addition to species, conservation and land managers need to consider other environmental factors that are critical to grazing effects and overall conservation. ©2011 Allred et al.","Allred, B.W.; Fuhlendorf, S.D.; Hamilton, R.G.","","2",2011,"Fire; Grassland; Grazing; Herbivory; Restoration; Species comparisons; Tallgrass prairie","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on the central and southern portions of the Great Plains, which is the largest continuous grassland in North America and has a well-documented mammalian fossil record. Modern biomass in this region is dominated by C4 grasses, but paleontological evidence indicates the region was forested prior to the middle Miocene, implying the region was formerly dominated by C3 plants. We examine long- and short-term variations in the abundance of C 4 grasses and climatic conditions in the central and southern Great Plains using the stable carbon and oxygen isotope composition of paleosol carbonates from 28 sections of 11 lithostratigraphic units in the region. The carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of paleosol carbonate reflects the proportion of C3 and C4 plants that grew in an ancient soil. The long-term pattern of δ13C values indicates that the percentage of C4 grasses in the Great Plains was moderate (ca. 20%) throughout most of the Miocene, increased from 6.4 to 4.0 Ma, and reached modern levels by 2.5 Ma. Based on the range in δ13C values within sections and the mean δ13C values for different carbonate morphologies that reflect different intervals of carbonate accumulation, the abundance of C4 biomass did not vary substantially on short time scales. The variability in C4 biomass on short time scales does not correlate with age of section, latitude, longitude, or the mean percentage of C4 biomass. The oxygen isotope composition (δ18O) of soil carbonate is controlled by soil temperature and the δ18O value of soil water. Great Plains paleosol δ18O values vary considerably in relation to time and latitude. Removing the variation due to latitude with least squares linear regression reveals a temporal pattern that is consistent with the global pattern of Neogene climate change. Quantitative interpretation of the δ18O record is difficult without independent control on temperature or the oxygen isotope composition of soil water, both of which have probably varied with long-term climate change. Comparisons of measured δ18O values for each section with predicted values based on modern temperature data and estimated modern meteoric water δ18O values suggest that (1) most Miocene sections have δ18O values consistent with warmer temperatures and more positively shifted soil water δ18O values than today, (2) three Miocene sections in western Nebraska probably had soil water compositions that were more negative than similar-aged localities in the region, and (3) the Plio-Pleistocene sections have δ18O values consistent with cooler temperatures and more negative soil water δ18O values than today. The paleosol δ13C values do not correlate strongly with the pattern of climate change recorded by the δ18O values, suggesting that long-term change in mean temperature is not the main control on the abundance of δ13C biomass in the Great Plains.

As human activities continue to alter environments and evolutionary processes, it becomes increasingly important to conserve standing genetic variation. Despite technical advances in population genetics, it is still useful to have inexpensive methods of detecting and monitoring genetic variation, particularly in traits that potentially influence fitness. In the Northern Leopard Frog, Lithobates pipiens (= Rana pipiens), genetically determined color (green [dominant: G] or brown [recessive: g]) and two pigment pattern polymorphisms (Burnsi/spotless [B] or spotted [b]; Kandiyohi/mottled [K] or non-mottled[k]) are hypothesized to have adaptive benefits. We assessed spatiotemporal patterns of these polymorphisms during two time periods in one of the largest remaining grasslands in North America. The frequency of the dominant green phenotype remained consistent from the early-to-late 2000s; however, we observed Kandiyohi phenotypes more frequently during 2001-2002 compared to 2009-2010. By contrast, we observed dominant Burnsi phenotypes more frequently in the latter time period. Although not statistically significant, we observed green phenotypes more frequently in areas with less water on the landscape and in locations closer to tree cover. Burnsi phenotypes were more common in wetlands that did not dry out and Kandiyohi phenotypes were more common in wetlands with aquatic vegetation, although not significantly. No pigment polymorphism was associated with body size. We found no indication of spatial structure, suggesting ample gene flow. The correlations were generally weak, but some were consistent with hypotheses of adaptive benefits.

We tested these hypotheses by experimentally parasitizing six grassland species with cowbird-like eggs and non-mimetic (blue) eggs in south-central Saskatchewan. Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii), Vesper (Pooecetes gramineus), Savannah (Passerculus sandwichensis), and Baird's (Ammodramus bairdii) sparrows, and Chestnut-collared Longspurs (Calcarius ornatus) accepted all or nearly all cowbird eggs, but ejected or attempted to eject between 9 and 20% of blue eggs with 54% of rejected eggs not removed from the nests, i.e., failed ejection attempts. Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) ejected an intermediate number of cowbird eggs (67%) and most blue eggs (92%), none of which was recovered. Ejection of non-mimetic eggs versus cowbird eggs by each species suggests that similarity in appearance of cowbird eggs and hosts' eggs impeded discrimination and may represent a form of cowbird egg mimicry. The low number of blue eggs ejected by five of the six species, their failure to remove these eggs from the nest sites, and the damage wrought on some hosts' eggs during ejection suggest the morphology of cowbird eggs also constrains ejection behavior. These results support the evolutionary equilibrium hypothesis as the better explanation for acceptance of cowbird parasitism observed in these grassland passerines.","Klippenstine, D.R.; Sealy, S.G.","","120",2008,"","","","","","","","","",""

However, knowledge of the mechanisms that drive spatiotemporal patterns in population dynamics are needed to inform scale-variant policy development. Using hierarchical Bayesian models and variable selection, we determined by which mechanism(s), and to what extent, changes in quantity and quality of surrogate grassland habitats contributed to regional variation in population trends of an obligatory grassland bird, Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorous). We used North American Breeding Bird Survey data to develop spatially explicit models of regional population trends over 25 years across 35 agricultural census divisions in Ontario, Canada. We measured the strength of evidence for effects of land-use change on population trends over the entire study period and over five subperiods. Over the entire study period, one region (Perth) displayed strong evidence of population decline (95% CI is entirely below 0); four regions displayed strong evidence of population increase (Bruce, Simcoe, Peterborough, and Northumberland). Population trends shifted spatially among subperiods, with more extreme declines later in time (1986–1990: 28% of 35 census divisions, 1991–1995: 46%, 1996–2000: 40%, 2001–2005: 66%, 2006–2010: 82%). Important predictors of spatial patterns in Bobolink population trends over the entire study period were human development and fragmentation. However, factors inferred to drive patterns in population trends were not consistent over space and time.

These grasslands may be particularly sensitive to one common disturbance, livestock grazing, because they have not recently evolved in the presence of large herds of bison, an important mammalian herbivore. This study examined how livestock grazing influenced vegetation-associated insect communities in southeastern Arizona. Insect abundance, richness, diversity, community composition, and key environmental variables were compared between sites on active cattle ranches and sites on a 3160 ha sanctuary that has not been grazed by cattle for over 25 years. Vegetation-associated insect communities were found to be sensitive to livestock grazing. Overall abundance of these insects was lower on grazed grasslands, and certain insect orders appeared to be negatively affected by livestock grazing; beetles were less rich, flies were less diverse, and Hymenoptera were less rich and diverse on grazed sites. Conversely, Hemiptera were more diverse on grazed sites. Species composition of vegetation-associated insect communities also differed and was significantly correlated with percent vegetation cover and number of shrubs. Insect species responsible for these differences were taxonomically diverse, and included herbivores and predators/parasites. When compared to other studies conducted in areas of the United States that fall within the historic range of bison, this study suggests that invertebrates in areas outside this range may be more sensitive to grazing pressure. © 2006 Springer.","Debano, S.J.","","15",2006,"Arizona; Grasslands; Insect communities; Insect conservation; Livestock grazing","","","","","","","","",""

Although matings between genetically distinct individuals may produce hybrid progeny of lower fitness than matings between genetically similar individuals, this is not always the case. Two species of North American leopard frogs (Rana blairi and R. sphenocephala) hybridize in central Missouri. To examine the relationship between genotypic fitness and the environment, I measured larval fitness components of the two leopard frog species and their interspecific hybrids using transplant experiments in field enclosures. This study was undertaken to compare larval fitness components of R. blairi, R. sphenocephala, and F1 hybrids in three natural aquatic habitats representative of a natural environmental gradient (prairie, woodland, and river floodplain). Larvae were reared either in single-genotype stands or in mixtures of all three genotypes. There was no evidence of reduced F1 hybrid larval performance in any environment. In fact, F1 hybrids metamorphosed larger than R. sphenocephala, but not R. blairi, in the river floodplain habitat. All genotypes produced the highest proportion of individuals surviving and metamorphosing in the floodplain habitat. Thus, hybrid genotypes performed equivalently to or better than their parental species in three aquatic habitat types. Transplant experiments such as these are critical for directly measuring genotype-by-environment interactions and for assessing the role of ecological factors in determining the adaptive potential of natural hybridization.","Parris, M.J.","","82",2001,"Amphibian larvae; Hybridization; Leopard frog; Rana blairi; Rana sphenocephala; Relative fitness; Transplant experiment","","","","","","","","",""

The surface of the chalk is severely scoured with groove markings, striations, and flute markings that suggest erosion, as by a bolide-generated tsunami wave at K/T boundary time. Numerous normal faults that offset the Prairie Bluff Chalk and that are in turn buried by the overlying Clayton basal sands indicate impact-related earthquakes. The Clayton basal sands consist of a chaotic layer of large-sized blocks of the Prairie Bluff Chalk and coarse sand at its contact with the Prairie Bluff Chalk and an overlying Danian inner-shelf micaceous clayey sand. The chaotic layer is interpreted as a tsunami-generated deposit. Analysis of benthic foraminifera in the Prairie Bluff Chalk and in the Danian shelf sands indicates that there was no significant change in sea level at K/T boundary time and that sea level was at a low stand. The abrupt cessation of Prairie Bluff Chalk deposition is evidence of a sudden extinction of marine biota.

Smaller parcels at the eastern edge (western Oklahoma) of the shortgrass prairie are bounded by far more fence and traversed by far more roads and power lines than are larger parcels at the western edge (eastern New Mexico). The increased extent of fencing, roads and power lines is associated with higher mortality of female, but not male, lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), a rare species endemic to the south-central United States. Differences in mortality rates appear to have selected for differences in life-history strategies: relative to females in New Mexico, female prairie-chickens in Oklahoma lay larger clutches and nest fewer years but make more attempts within a year.

The wild ancestors of these crops have small seeds with indigestible defences and do not germinate readily. Today, these wild plants exist in small fragmentary stands that are not appealing targets for foragers. This combination of traits has led many to argue that they must have been a food of last resort. We propose a new explanation: the domestication of small-seeded annuals involved a switch from endozoochoric dispersal (through animal ingestion) to human dispersal. Humans encountered these plants in dense stands created by grazing megafauna, making them easy to harvest. As humans began to cultivate these plants they took on the functional role of seed dispersers, and traits associated with endozoochory were lost or reduced. The earliest traits of domestication—thinning or loss of indigestible seed protections, loss of dormancy and increased seed size—can all be explained by the loss of the ruminant dispersal process and concomitant human management of wild stands. We demonstrate, by looking at rangeland ecology and herd animal herbivory patterns, that the progenitors of all of these species evolved to be dispersed by megafaunal ruminants and that heavy herbivory leads to dense homogenous clusters of endozoochoric plants. Hence, easily harvested stands on nitrogen hot spots near water sources would have existed in regions where these plants were domesticated.

By contrast, their former extent and abundance across the Upper Midwest prairie belt has never been systematically established due to their destruction by agriculture and historic confusion as to whether they were natural or anthropic mounds. Recent maps showing their distribution identify only two small moundfields, one centered on Waubun Prairie in western Minnesota, the other on Kalsow Prairie in north-central Iowa. But in fact, natural mounds were once a common feature of many Upper Midwest prairies, having extended from Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois north into Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, the Dakotas, and across the prairies and parklands of Canada. Several remnant tracts, intact and preserved, bear witness to their former much greater extent. This chapter documents the original distribution across the prairie belt, which has implications for their origin insofar as it falls more or less entirely within the range of the Geomyidae (pocket gopher) family of fossorial rodents. Natural prairie mounds in the Upper Midwest invariably are found where limitations to vertical burrowing occur, or did occur, which leaves lateral burrowing as the only option to these and other soil animals. Owing to extensive overlaps between natural mounds and morphologically similar prehistoric ""Moundbuilder"" mounds, the idea is advanced that prairie mounds were opportunistically used for prehistoric interments, and later as ideation templates for prehistoric burial, effigy, and other mounds and utilitarian structures. © 2012 The Geological Society of America.

At higher altitudes, woody plants can occur as shrubs and krummholz, by benefiting from warmer day-time temperatures close to the ground. Inverted timberlines against valley floors are related to nocturnal temperature inversions and repeated daily freeze-thaw cycles. Evidence favouring these interpretations comes from experiments in the Craigieburn Range, New Zealand, in which seedlings of the local timberline species, Nothofagus solandri, and various overseas timberline species were grown in a series of gardens above and below the natural timberline. Although seedlings show decreasing growth with increasing altitude, tree limit is better explained in terms of the ripening of shoots so that they can withstand unfavourable winter conditions, than by the hypothesis relating it to the ability to achieve a positive CO2 balance. Physiognomic differences among timberlines are related to other physiological characteristics such as light requirements, growth rates, and mycorrhizal associations, and to winter severity, which affects the floristic diversity and incidence of deciduousness. Above tree limit, predominance of large herbs and medium-sized shrubs in the lower part of the alpine belt in New Guinea and New Zealand reflects milder conditions than prevail in the Northern Hemisphere. Among woody plants, shrubby genera have shown the most speciation above timberline, but some tree species have evolved dwarf relatives. Nothofagus solandri seedlings grown on a valley floor below an inverted timberline fail to survive winter unless shaded, but North American conifers are fully winter hardy at the same site. In New Guinea, depressions supporting tussock grassland dotted with Cyathea tree ferns are considered to be basically related to frost. © 1971 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Wardle, P.","","9",1971,"","","","","","","","","",""

The continuous boreal forest region shows in general a predominance of conifer pollen in the spectra. Broad-leaved deciduous forests, represented very poorly in this region, are distinguished by the high values of pollen grains of oak, birch, elm and ash.

One hundred and one years ago, Thismia americana was discovered in a prairie near Chicago in the United States. This tiny mycoheterotrophic plant was observed at the type locality for a few years but is now considered to be extinct. The occurrence of the mainly tropical genus Thismia in temperate North America remains a mystery, particularly because T. americana's putative most closely related species occurs in Australia and New Zealand. Here we evaluate the affinities of T. americana using morphological data and the relationships of the two other species in Thismia subgen. Thismia sect. Rodwaya with molecular data. Methodology. A 21-character morphological data set of 50 Thismia species was analyzed with parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. A data set of eight species of Thismia and allied taxa containing sequence data of the nuclear 18S and mitochondrial atp1 regions was analyzed with maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogeny inference methods, including a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analysis. Pivotal results. Morphological data indicate that T. americana is most closely related to the Old World species of Thismia. Nuclear and mitochondrial data suggest that Old World species of Thismia are part of a single clade but also show that the section Rodwaya is not a monophyletic group. Conclusions. The results suggest that T. americana diverged from an Old World ancestor, but the morphological similarity of T. americana to other species in the section Rodwaya may result from the presence of plesiomorphic characters or convergent evolution rather than close phylogenetic affinity. Northern Hemisphere species of Thismia may be more plausible close relatives of T. americana. Under the latter scenario, T. americana would be part of an Amphi-Pacific Northern Hemisphere disjunction, a more commonly observed distribution pattern in plants. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

Pollen has long been used as a proxy for reconstructing climate changes, but its power is limited if a region is devoid of modern pollen samples to facilitate comparison with known climate conditions. Here, we present a set of pollen-climate transfer functions developed using weighted-averaging partial least squares to reconstruct mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean temperature of the coldest month (MTcold) and mean temperature of the warmest month (MTwarm). At the foundation of these transfer functions is a new set of 141 modern pollen samples that specifically cover the climate space of the Great Plains. These functions quantify the relationship between pollen assemblages and modern climate in this region (r = 0.928, 0.838 and 0.897 for MAP, MTcold and MTwarm, respectively). We applied these functions to three previously established pollen records taken from lacustrine sites in the region – Fox Lake, MN; Moon Lake, ND; and Kettle Lake, ND – to reconstruct precipitation and temperature at these sites throughout the Holocene. Annual precipitation reconstructed with these transfer functions at Moon Lake and Kettle Lake does not capture a severe, prolonged period of drought during the mid-Holocene as seen in many other proxy records from these sites and from the region. Reconciliation of these results involves both the autecology of Ambrosia and the inability of any pollen surface samples to capture seasonal and short-term variability in precipitation. Thus, the transfer functions correctly reconstruct periodic wet summers and a disturbance factor favouring Ambrosia, but miss the effects of reduced winter precipitation and increased frequency of severe drought. The problem revealed here may be more general to biomes with higher frequency disturbance regimes and more weedy species. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","Commerford, J.L.; Grimm, E.C.; McLauchlan, K.K.; Morris, C.J.; Nurse, A.; Stefanova, I.","","38",2018,"Ambrosia; Great Plains; WAPLS; grasslands; paleoclimate; pollen; transfer functions","","","","","","","","",""

This was associated with (1) major cooling and increasing continentality and the enormous spread of grasslands in most continents, replacing closed and open forests, and (2) hypsodonty, the possession of high-crowned teeth. Hypsodonty is traditionally linked with eating grass because of the contained phytoliths, silica-rich granules, which are presumed to wear away mammalian dental tissues. However, we present evidence from the Great Plains of North America that the origins of hypsodonty in different clades of ungulates (hoofed mammals) and Glires (rodents and lagomorphs) were substantially out of synchrony with the great spread of grasslands, 26-22. Myr ago (latest Oligocene/earliest Miocene). Moderate hypsodonty was acquired by some Oligocene artiodactyls and several rodent families (mainly burrowers) at least 7. Myr earlier. Highly hypsodont ungulates and hypselodont (= ever-growing cheek teeth) rodents post-date the spread of grasslands by 4 to 9. Myr. Lagomorphs follow a different trend, with hypselodont forms present from near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary.

To obtain a more accurate hydrogeologic characterization of the Ordovician Prairie du Chien Group, a new approach was tested, combining detailed geologic observations, particularly of secondary porosity, with hydraulic data. Lithologic observations of the depositional and erosional history of the carbonate-dominated bedrock unit constrained characterization of both primary (matrix) and secondary porosity from outcrops and core. Hydrostratigraphic data include outcrop and core observations along with core plug permeability tests. Hydrogeologic data include discrete interval aquifer tests, borehole geophysics, water chemistry and isotope data, and dye trace studies. Results indicate that the Prairie du Chien Group can be subdivided into the Shakopee aquifer at the top, consisting of interbedded dolostone, sandstone and shale, and the underlying Oneota confining unit consisting of thickly bedded dolostone. The boundary between these two hydrogeologic units does not correspond to lithostratigraphic boundaries, as commonly presumed. Groundwater flow in the Shakopee aquifer is primarily through secondary porosity features, most commonly solution-enlarged bedding planes and sub-horizontal and vertical fractures. Regional scale preferential development of cavernous porosity and permeability along specific stratigraphic intervals that correspond to paleokarst were also identified, along with a general depiction of the distribution of vertical and horizontal fractures. The combination of outcrop and core investigations, along with borehole geophysics, discrete interval aquifer tests, water chemistry and isotope data and dye trace studies show that the Prairie du Chien Group is best represented hydrogeologically as heterogeneous and anisotropic.

We mapped spatial population genetic structure for 17 animal species across the Mojave Desert, USA. We analyzed these in concurrence and located 10 regions of high genetic diversity, divergence or both among species.

The high amount of exchangeable calcium in grassland soils is likely due to cycling by vegetation and perhaps, aeolian inputs of Ca and Mg carbonates.

Clay mineralogy is dominated by volcanic glass, quartz, feldspars and minimal quantities of kaolinite and dehydrated halloysite in surficial horizons. Kaolinite is assumed to be of detrital origin while dehydrated halloysite is a product of a low leaching and dry environment where limited resilication occurs.

However, where relevant, examples from mammals are also included. Tidal marshes are structurally and floristically simple habitats that are highly productive and spatially variable in quality, a variability that is magnified by the local effects of tidal inundation. Such conditions are thought to contribute to the evolution of polygynous mating systems. Over half (five species) of the saltmarsh-breeding species are commonly polygynous. This distribution of mating systems is not appreciably different from closely related species or subspecies of freshwater marsh or grassland habitats. The distribution of breeding territories in some tidal-marsh birds show a strong tendency to aggregate around certain habitat features, leaving regularly flooded tidal flats as shared feeding areas. In addition, some mammals show a tendency to form aggregations and an increase in social tolerance, partly in response to the forced crowding the tidal flooding can impose. The unusual non-territorial spacing behavior and related scramble, polygynous mating system of the sharp-tailed sparrows (Ammodramus spp.). may be an endpoint in the tendency for sparrows to occur in local high-density semi-colonial conditions, where males are no longer to defend territories. The sharp-tailed sparrow social system may have evolved in response to its subordinate relationship with syntopic Seaside Sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus). In this structurally simple, but zonal habitat, interspecific territoriality and avoidance seem to be well developed among passerine and possibly small mammal taxa.","Greenberg, R.; McDonald, M.V.","","",2006,"Ammodramus; Bird; Breeding patterns; Mammal; Mating systems; Salt marsh; Spatial distributions","","","","","","","","",""

This study assesses the spectral properties of sedimentary chlorophyll a using visible-near infrared reflectance (VNIR) spectroscopy, with the objective of establishing a new, non-destructive paleolimnological proxy. Reflectance spectra were determined from a dilution series (n = 10) involving incremental additions of pulverized modern algae to a lake sediment matrix of low organic content. This enabled an assessment of the development of sediment reflectance spectra in relation to different sediment chlorophyll a concentrations, and subsequent regression of spectral features against measured concentrations of chlorophyll a and derivatives obtained by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The experiment demonstrates that ubiquitous troughs in sediment reflectance near 675 nm are attributable to chlorophyll a and derivative compounds. A significant correlation (r 2 = 0.98, P &lt; 0.01) was obtained between the area of the reflectance trough in the 650-700 nm interval and summed concentrations of chlorophyll a, all derivative isomers, and degradational pheopigments. A simple linear inference model derived from this experiment was applied to a down-core sequence of VNIR spectra from a productive prairie lake (Alberta, Canada), where it produced inferred sediment chlorophyll a concentrations in concordance with HPLC measurements.

The fossil record suggests that diversification down to the level of species groups had occurred before the end of the Tertiary, and some presently existing distribution patterns, such as the dicentric one involving the central grassland barrier, undoubtedly have existed since the Tertiary. Most present distribution patterns, however, seem to have had their origins in the Pleistocene, and the increase in number of species within species groups is largely attributable to Pleistocene events. Presently existing southern disjunct populations of relatively northern species reflect southward displacement during the Wisconsin glaciation and suggest the mechanism whereby various species have originated as a result of earlier Pleistocene glaciations. Northern disjuncts are rare, as might be expected, and are attributable to minor post-Wisconsin fluctuations in climate. The existence of various east-west species pairs of anurans in the eastern United States is attributed to splitting of previous ranges in these warmth-adapted animals through southward shift of climatic zones during glacial stages. Minor disjunets along the forest-grasslands border suggest a possible, alternative source for such pairs. East-west disjunction of urodeles presumably involved spread during glacial stages, followed by disjunction during interglacials. Anuran relicts in the southwestern deserts represent remnants of pluvial-stage distributions. There is evidence for extensive montane speciation in connection with Pleistocene climatic change in the Sierra Nevada and in the Appalachian Mountains but not in the Rocky Mountains. There is limited evidence for the role of the glacial boundaries in urodele evolution. For the most thoroughly studied species groups of anurans it is possible to postulate the sequence of Pleistocene dichotomies that led to the present composition of the group. © 1965, by Princeton University Press.

High levels of population genetic diversity may buffer foundation species against climate disruptions, but the strong selective pressures associated with climatic shifts may also rapidly reduce such diversity. We characterized genetic diversity and its responsiveness to experimental drought in the foundation plant, black grama grass (Bouteloua eriopoda), which dominates many western North American grasslands and shrublands. Previous studies suggested that in arid ecosystems, black grama reproduces largely asexually via stolons, and thus is likely to have low genetic variability, which might limit its potential to respond to climate disruptions. Using genotyping-by-sequencing, we demonstrated unexpectedly high genetic variability among black grama plants in a 1 ha site within the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico, suggesting some level of sexual reproduction. Three years of experimental, growing season drought reduced black grama survival and biomass (the latter by 96%), with clear genetic differentiation (higher F ST ) between plants succumbing to drought and those remaining alive. Reduced genetic variability in the surviving plants in drought plots indicated that the experimental drought had forced black grama populations through selection bottlenecks.

The absence of pollen in the southern Great Plains is widespread, encompassing many lacustrine and alluvial deposits. This absence or poor preservation of pollen and other organic matter within these materials is probably the result of post-depositional biotic or chemical oxidation, perhaps related to drying out of the deposits and subsequent movement of meteoric or ground water through the sediments. Among southern Plains localities barren of pollen are the type sections of the Clarendonian, Hemphillian, and Blancan North American Land Mammal ages in Texas. Other localities barren of pollen or containing low concentrations of poorly preserved grains include the Laverne (Miocene), Camp Rice (early Pleistocene), and Tule (early-middle Pleistocene) formations, sediments below the Pearlette O (""Lava Creek B"") and Bishop ashes (middle Pleistocene), the Slaton (Illinoian), Easley Ranch (Sangamon), Quiteque, Jones, Howard Ranch (Wisconsinan), Clovis, Lubbock Lake, and Plainview sites (late Wisconsin-Holocene), and several early Holocene lacustrine and alluvial localities.

Plant populations in tallgrass prairie likely experience, or historically experienced, high risks of damage and therefore might be expected to have evolved significant compensation ability. We investigated shoot damage and subsequent growth compensation in Iowa populations of the annuals Linum rigidum and L. sulcatum. To estimate damage rate and responses to damage under natural conditions, we collected two data sets. The first consisted of over 200 herbarium specimens collected over a 113-y period and the second consisted of field data for four populations in the same growing season. A companion experiment investigated damage responses under controlled greenhouse conditions and identified possible mechanisms of compensation. The study species frequently experience apical meristem removal in nature. Per-individual damage-rate estimates ranged from 33-54% in L. rigidum and from 12-24% in L. sulcatum. Both species compensate substantially in mature height, branch number and biomass under field conditions. Compensation in the greenhouse tended to be incomplete, perhaps because the greenhouse experiment may have failed to simulate natural conditions and ended before maximum sizes had been reached. The major mechanism of compensation appears to be rapid activation of axillary meristems, without contributions from altered root-shoot partitioning.

They got to South America by waif dispersal across the Bolivar Trough marine barrier from Central America during a world wide drop in sea level (the “Messinian Low”) between 7.0 and 5.0 Myr BP. The basal stock was probably a sylvan (forest) form, from which evolved pastoral (grazing) forms in the savanna-grassland area of Venezuela, Colombia and the Guianas. The pastoral forms in the northern savanna-grassland area were restricted there until about 3.5 Myr BP. At that time there occurred the first glaciation in South America and consonant with glacial advance was a retraction of forest habitats and an expansion of savanna-grassland habitats. At that time the pastoral forms were able to disperse southward through a savanna-grassland corridor along the eastern foothills of the Andes and spread throughout the previously disjunct savanna-grasslands of Bolivia and Argentina. Cricetines are first recorded as fossil in the Monte Hermoso Fm. of Argentina which is about 3.5 Myr BP in age.

The discrepancy in the distribution between fossils and extant species indicates a mysterious evolution history requiring further exploration. This study compiles the worldwide fossils of Pteromyini to the species level in order to reproduce the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of flying squirrels and deduce the ancestral distribution according to dispersal-vicariance analysis of a phylogeny of the extant species. In addition, we reconstruct the paleoenvironmental background and find that flying squirrels probably originated in the Oligocene-Miocene transition from Europe and immediately dispersed to Asia and North America. Influenced by glaciation, CO2 reduction, geologic movements and the Paratethys retreat, the Northern Hemisphere underwent climate deterioration and grassland expansion during the late Miocene, and thus the diversity of Pteromyini dramatically decreased. The uplift of the Tibet Plateau in addition to the strengthened Asian monsoons intensified the aridity in central Asia, but brought sufficient water to the densely forested regions of South and Southeast Asia. These forests are likely both refugia and diversification center for flying squirrels during glacial periods in the Quarternary. The subsequent connection and separation events among these heterogeneous habitats has probably been a driving force in the speciation of flying squirrels.

Here we analyzed a series of qualitative, meristic, and morphometric traits from 347 specimens of C. scutulatus and show that this species is phenotypically cohesive without discrete subgroups, and that morphology follows a continuous cline in primarily color pattern and meristic traits across the major axis of its expansive distribution. Interpreted in the context of previously published molecular evidence, our morphological analyses suggest that multiple episodes of isolation and secondary contact among metapopulations during the Pleistocene were sufficient to produce distinctive genetic populations, which have since experienced gene flow to produce clinal variation in phenotypes without discrete or diagnosable distinctions among these original populations. For taxonomic purposes, we recommend that C. scutulatus be retained as a single species, although it is possible that C. s. salvini, which is morphologically the most distinctive population, could represent a peripheral isolate in the initial stages of speciation.

Despite this, few studies have directly compared behavior between populations. Because the prairie vole is commonly discussed as a model for mammalian monogamy, understanding how aspects of social attachment and the mating system vary could provide further insight into the evolution of monogamy. We therefore conducted a series of experiments in the laboratory and field to assess morphological, behavioral, or genetic differences between 2 populations of this species. Voles from Illinois were morphologically similar to voles from Tennessee and exhibited comparable social and mating behavior under both laboratory and field conditions. Although genetically distinct, the 2 populations demonstrated similar levels of heterozygosity and allelic richness. Sexual dimorphism, a common indicator of mating strategy, was absent in voles from 7 widely distributed regions from across their geographic range. In the context of these results, we question the degree to which the previously described population differences are ecologically meaningful. If differences between prairie voles from Kansas and Illinois do indeed exist, examination of our data suggests that those from Kansas are atypical of prairie voles overall. © 2007 American Society of Mammalogists.","Ophir, A.G.; Phelps, S.M.; Sorin, A.B.; Wolff, J.O.","","88",2007,"Illinois; Mating system; Microsatellite loci; Microtus ochrogaster; Monogamy; Pair bond; Population differences; Sexual dimorphism; Social behavior; Tennessee","","","","","","","","",""

Soil aggregate stability is a key indicator of soil structure and is correlated with erodibility and water infiltration capacity. In 2000, we compared soil aggregate stability of a complex of Simona (Loamy, mixed, thermic, shallow Typic Paleorthids) and Harrisburg (Coarse-loamy, mixed, thermic, Typic Paleorthids) soils in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland. We examined soil stability at plant and landscape scales by assessing percentage aggregate stability at four sites in two cover classes (plant vs. interspace) located within each of three grass cover and land disturbance classes. To increase measurement sensitivity to changes in soil structure and identify potential early warning indicators for monitoring, we used two different methods for quantifying wet aggregate stability: a laboratory method using a 0.25 mm sieve and a field method using a 1.5 mm sieve. As expected, soil aggregate stability was significantly higher under grass plants than in plant interspaces (44.2 vs. 38.4 for the lab test and 4.4 vs. 3.3 for the field test; P < 0.01). The field test showed higher stability in plots with higher grass cover throughout the top 10 mm soil layer, while disturbance level only affected stability at the soil surface. The laboratory test was insensitive to differences in grass cover and disturbance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Species composition of vegetation varies continuously in time as well as space in the absence of acute perturbations. Species have been added to or removed from ecosystems without greatly affecting ecosystem function. Natural ecosystems exhibit greater stability (inertia) in physiognomic structure and functional processes than in species composition. For instance, creosotebush Larrea tridentata became dominant over many millions of hectares of the Chihuahuan, Sonoran, and Mojave Deserts over a short period of 11 000 yr, but a limited number of generations precludes establishment of highly integrated and biologically regulated communities by co-evolution. Dramatic shifts in species composition of eastern deciduous forests of North America occurred in prehistory and continue into the present. Similar changes are noted in the constant assembling and reassembling of species in the purportedly ancient and stable forests of the tropics. Numerous introductions with few extinctions in the flora of California have increased species richness and probably diversity, and many recent additions are primary contributors to ecosystem productivity. Recognition that rangeland ecosystems persist in unstable rather than stable species compositions provides both a challenge and an opportunity for natural resource management. -from Authors","Johnson, H.B.; Mayeux, H.S.","","45",1992,"","","","","","","","","",""

However, even highly dynamic communities can be viewed within the framework of stable-state theory if an appropriate “ecologically relevant” time scale is identified. The ecologically relevant time scale for dynamic systems needs to conform to the amount of time needed for a system's community to complete an entire cycle through its normal range of variation. For some systems, the ecologically relevant period can be relatively short (eg, tidal systems), for others it can be decadal (eg, prairie wetlands). We explore the concept of alternative stable states in unstable systems using the highly dynamic wetland ecosystems of North America's Prairie Pothole Region. The communities in these wetland ecosystems transition through multiple states in response to decadal-long climate oscillations that cyclically influence ponded-water depth, permanence, and chemistry. The perspective gained by considering dynamic systems in the context of stable-state theory allows for an increased understanding of how these systems respond to changing drivers that can push them past tipping points into alternative states. Incorporation of concepts inherent to stable-state theory has been suggested as a key scientific element upon which to base sustainable environmental management. Published 2019.

Because grassland C3/C4 ratios correlate with climate, the δ13C of fossil grazers may serve as a proxy for reconstructing paleoclimates and paleovegetation patterns. However, the accuracy of environmental reconstructions based on herbivore δ13C values is often uncertain, because the relationship between the δ13C of many animals and the abundance of C4 and C3 grasses has not been precisely quantified. We analyzed the δ13C of tooth enamel carbonate from modern bison (Bison bison bison) from nine localities in the United States. The C4 grass biomass at these sites ranged from &lt;1% to ∼95% of the total grass biomass. The mean δ13C of enamel for each population correlated well with the local abundance of C4 grasses and with variations in mean annual temperatures. The variability of enamel δ13C values did not differ among habitats and was not correlated with the abundance of C4 grasses. These results demonstrate that analyses of the δ13C values of fossil bison can be used as a quantitative proxy for reconstructing grassland C3/C4 ratios and paleotemperatures, and they will serve as a baseline for interpreting the δ13C of fossil bison and other large herbivores in North America. © 2006 Geological Society of America.","Chamberlain, P.; Hoppe, K.A.; Paytan, A.","","34",2006,"Bison; Carbon isotopes; Diet; Enamel; Grasslands","","","","","","","","",""

Although much is known about this species, conservation efforts are hindered because the specific factors that contribute to its emergence and anthesis are unknown. We used long-term monitoring data from three sites in the central part of WPFO's range to determine which environmental variables contribute to the plant's emergence and anthesis. We then compared our anthesis model to 110 years of herbarium and iNaturalist.org records over WPFO's entire range. From our monitoring data, we found that accumulated growing degree days (GDD, 0 °C baseline and no maximum temperature) best explained plant emergence (199.05), while anthesis was best explained by GDD accumulation (1561.8), adequate precipitation, and the passage of the summer solstice. In our historical data set, anthesis occurred post-solstice in 95% of the records, which suggests that the strongest driver of anthesis in WPFO is day length. Understanding those conditions that contribute to WPFO phenology is critical for its conservation, and management, such as prescribed fire, which should be avoided during active growth periods. Although WPFO evolution occurred in a variable climate, it appears to have a fixed anthesis trigger, day length, which increases its vulnerability to climate change. WPFO is also sensitive to drought conditions, which are expected to increase in the future. Therefore, intervention may be necessary to ensure the species’ long-term viability. © 2018 The Authors","Derek, A.; Jeanne, P.; John, P.; Judy, B.; Lori A, B.; Nancy, S.","","16",2018,"Climate change; Great plains north America; Museum collections; Tallgrass prairie; iNaturalist.org","","","","","","","","",""

The initial rise of extensive grasslands probably commenced in the Miocene-Pliocene transition (7-5 m.y. ago), the driest part of the Tertiary, which restricted forests and woodlands and encouraged the explosive evolution of grasses and forbs. Following the fluctuation of Pleistocene climatevegetation zones, warm, dry Altithermal climate restricted wooded tracts at the expense of spreading grasslands. The rise of the grassland biome was thus due to occasional periods of increased aridity that restricted forests and woodlands and favored grasses and forbs; to increasing drought west of the 100th meridian which created a flammable source (dry grass); to natural and man-made fires on the relatively flat plains over which fire could spread uninterruptedly; to fire that destroyed relict trees and groves on the flat grasslands, restricting them to rocky ridges removed from fire; and probably also to large browsing mammals (many now extinct) that may have destroyed scattered trees and shrubs on the interfluves during the Altithermal. Youthfulness of the grassland biome agrees with a) the occurrence of most of its species in the bordering forests and woodlands, b) the presence of few endemic plants in it, a relation shown also by insects and birds, c) the relict occurrence of diverse trees over the region, and d) the invasion of grassland by woody vegetation. © 1985 The New York Botanical Garden.","Axelrod, D.I.","","51",1985,"","","","","","","","","",""

The Wendel site was a paleolake from about 11,500 14C yr BP to 11,100 14C yr BP. Afterwards, the lake-level lowered until it became a prairie marsh by 9,300 14C yr BP and finally, at 8,500 14C yr BP, an ephemeral wetland as it is today. Meanwhile, the vegetation changed from a white spruce parkland (11,500 to 10,500 14C yr BP) to deciduous parkland, followed by grassland at 9,300 14C yr BP. The pattern and timing of these aquatic and terrestrial changes are similar to coeval kettle lake records from adjacent uplands, providing a regional aridity signal. However, two local sources of ground water were identified from the fossil and geochemical data, which mediated atmospheric inputs to the Wendel basin. First, the paleolake received water from the melting of stagnant ice buried under local till for about 900 years after glacier recession.

Mammoths (Mammuthus spp.) in the American Southwest were hunted by Clovis people during a period of rapid climate change, just before the regional onset of Younger Dryas cooling and mammoth extirpation. Thus, these mammoths may provide key insights into late Pleistocene extinction processes. Herewereconstruct the seasonal diet and climatic conditions experienced by mammoths in the San Pedro Valley of Arizona, using the carbon ( 13C/ 12C) and oxygen ( 18O/ 16O) isotope compositions of tooth enamel. These records suggest that Clovis mammoths experienced a warm, dry climate with sufficient summer rainfall to support seasonal C 4 plant growth. Monsoon intensity may have been reduced relative to the preceding time period, but there is no isotopic evidence for severe drought. However, it is possible that the ""Clovis drought"", inferred from stratigraphic evidence, occurred suddenly at the end of the animals' lives and thus was not recorded in the enamel isotopic compositions. Unlike mammoths that lived before the Last Glacial Maximum, Clovis mammoths regularly increased C 4 grass consumption during summer, probably seeking seasonally green grasslands farther from the river valley. This predictable seasonal behavior may have made mammoths easier to locate by Clovis hunters. Furthermore, Clovis mammoths probably had no previous experience of such sudden climatic change as is believed to have occurred at the timeof their extinction.","Ballenger, J.A.M.; Longstaffe, F.J.; Metcalfe, J.Z.; Vance Haynes Jr., C.","","108",2011,"Bioapatite; Geochemistry; Paleoclimate; Paleoindian; Stable isotopes","","","","","","","","",""

In Mexico, the results of these two methods have not been compared for proboscideans. It is considered important to apply both methods to complement the information obtained in each case. This study aimed to infer the diet and habitat of Mammuthus columbi from two Late Pleistocene localities, La Cinta-Portalitos and La Piedad-Santa Ana (Michoacan-Guanajuato) in west-central Mexico, to provide reliable data about paleoenvironments. The isotopic analysis showed no significant differences in the values of δ13C, but there were significant differences for δ18O. Furthermore, the isotopic values indicated that populations of M. columbi of both sites had, on average, a mixed diet (C3/C4), with some grazer individuals (C4) and habitat preference for open areas. Dental microwear analysis suggested that populations of M. columbi in both sites were grazers (grasses). The use of both techniques provided more reliable information about the eating habits and habitat preferences of extinct animals.

Most soil and underlying sediments near the well have a hydraulic conductivity of 0.3 m3/day. Flow net analysis suggests that less than 25 percent infiltrates, with the remaining water lost to surface flow and evapotranspiration (ET). Evapotranspiration and slow infiltration has led to increased salinization, with shallow soils exhibiting EC to 500 milliSiemens/m.

Impacts of conversions from natural ecosystems to rain-fed agriculture on water resources are recorded in chloride profiles in semiarid regions, as typified by the southern High Plains (SHP), Texas, southwestern United States. Large chloride accumulations beneath natural grassland and shrubland ecosystems (3 profiles) reflect evapotranspirative enrichment of atmospherically derived chloride during the Holocene, indicating no recharge in interdrainage areas. Conversion to rain-fed agriculture is recorded by downward displacement (9 profiles) or complete flushing (10 profiles) of chloride bulges, indicating increased recharge. Increased recharge associated with cultivation (median 24 mm/yr, 5% of precipitation, 19 profiles) was quantified using chloride mass balance calculations. The timing of land use change was estimated using chloride data, and results (43-89 years) are consistent with aerial photo records and landowner surveys. New equilibrium volumetric recharge rates beneath rain-fed agriculture in the SHP (0.63 km3/yr) will require decades to establish and represent one to eight times recharge rates for baseline precultivated conditions that are focused beneath ephemeral lake or playa drainages (0.08-0.83 km3/yr).

Composite and correlation analyses indicate that precipitation over a large region of southern Canada extending from British Columbia, through the prairies, and into the Great Lakes region is significantly influenced by the SO phenomenon.

Statistical significance of the responses is tested by the Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while field significance is estabished throught the Monte Carlo procedure.

Hyperaccumulation has been hypothesized to defend against herbivory. In laboratory studies high Se levels protect plants from invertebrate herbivores and pathogens. However, field studies and mammalian herbivore studies that link Se accumulation to herbivory protection are lacking. In this study a combination of field surveys and manipulative field studies were carried out to determine whether plant Se accumulation in the field deters herbivory by black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). The Se hyperaccumulator Astragalus bisulcatus (two-grooved milkvetch) occurs naturally on seleniferous soils in the Western USA, often on prairie dog colonies. Field surveys have shown that this Se hyperaccumulator is relatively abundant on some prairie dog colonies and suffers less herbivory than other forb species. This protection was likely owing to Se accumulation, as judged from subsequent manipulative field experiments. When given a choice between pairs of plants of the Se hyperaccumulator Stanleya pinnata (prince's plume) that were pretreated with or without Se, prairie dogs preferred to feed on the plants with low Se; the same results were obtained for the non-hyperaccumulator Brassica juncea (Indian mustard). Plants containing as little as 38 mg Se kg-1 DW were protected from herbivory. Taken together these results shed light on the functional significance of Se hyperaccumulation and the possible selection pressures driving its evolution.

Yet, the use of this tool appears to have the unintended effect of favoring the regeneration of some introduced grasses. Although both native and introduced perennial grasses evolved under the influence of fire, it is their response to mycotrophy in the immediate postburn environment that appears to give some grasses such as Lovegrass the advantage. In an exploratory study, two greenhouse experiments were completed in conjunction with a larger field study. A bioassay of soil from the study site found that soil exposed to burning had a significantly (p ≤ 0.0001) lower mycorrhizal infection percentage than soil not exposed to burning, results which could not be explained by postburn erosion losses of inoculum alone. Results of the second greenhouse study revealed that differential response to mycotrophy clearly separated the Lovegrass ( Eragrostis spp.) from the other genera studied. Lovegrass not infected by mycorrhizal fungi produced greater shoot biomass and inflorescence before the other noninfected studied grasses. Yet, infected Lovegrass did not develop inflorescence before harvest as the other genera infected by the mycorrhizal fungi did. Study results suggest that the lack of dependence by Lovegrass on mycorrhizal infection for reestablishing itself in the postburn environment gives it an advantage over those that do. © 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.","O'dea, M.E.","","15",2007,"Bouteluoa; Eragrostis; Introduced grasses; Lycurus; Mycorrhizae; Perennial; Prescribed fire","","","","","","","","",""

We use δ13C to evaluate the contribution of C3 and C4 plants to deep soil organic matter to reconstruct pre-human contact vegetation patterns along a wet to dry climate transect on Kohala Mountain, Hawaii Island. Precontact vegetation assemblages fall into three distinct zones: a wet C3 dominated closed canopy forest where annual rainfall is &gt; 2000 mm, a dry C4 dominated grassland with annual rainfall &lt; 500 mm, and a broad transition zone between these communities characterized by either C3 trees with higher water-use efficiency than the rainforest trees or C3 trees with a small amount of C4 grasses intermixed. The likelihood of C4 grass understory decreases with increasing rainfall. We show that the total concentration of rock-derived nutrients in the &lt; 2-mm soil fraction differs in each of these vegetation zones. Nutrient losses are driven by leaching at high rainfall and by plant cycling and wind erosion at low rainfall. By contrast, nutrients are best preserved in surface soils of the intermediate rainfall zone, where rainfall supports abundant plant growth but does not contribute large amounts of water in excess of evapotranspiration.

Wildlife inhabiting the native prairies of North America evolved in a heterogeneous mosaic of habitat conditions created by fire and grazing by native ungulates. Current rangeland management practices in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem evenly distribute fire and grazing across management units and promote homogeneous habitat conditions. Patch-burn grazing is a rangeland management strategy that seeks to restore heterogeneity to rangelands via fire-grazing interactions. Our 3.5-year study tested the effects of patch-burn grazing on habitat heterogeneity and small mammal community dynamics in the Flint Hills ecoregion of eastern Kansas. To study the ecological effects of patch-burn grazing, we sampled habitat conditions and the small mammal community. We assessed habitat conditions once each growing season in a negative control that was annually burned and grazed, a positive control that was burned every four years and ungrazed, and within each of three units of a patch-burn grazing experiment (PBG) managed with rotational fire. Habitat conditions were significantly different among treatments, and a principal components analysis showed that the patch-burn grazing treatment had higher canopy cover of forbs and habitat heterogeneity than our two control units. To sample the small mammal community, we conducted monthly live trapping of small mammals on two randomly located trap grids in each of our two controls and three units of our PBG treatment. Small mammal diversity was significantly higher in the patch-burn grazing treatment and in the positive control, vs. the negative control. Moreover, a canonical correspondence analysis showed that a fire-grazing interaction was the major driver structuring small mammal communities. Patch-burn grazing is an effective strategy for restoring heterogeneity to vegetative structure and composition, and can increase biodiversity of small mammals in managed rangelands in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. © 2016 Ricketts and Sandercock.","Ricketts, A.M.; Sandercock, B.K.","","7",2016,"Fire; Heterogeneity; Pyric herbivory; Rangeland management; Rodent; Tallgrass prairie","","","","","","","","",""

Analytical solutions and multiphase flow and transport modeling constrained flux histories and current fluxes across the water table at each site. Chloride bulge profiles containing ∼12-15kyr of atmospheric deposition and long-term drying water potential profiles typified most desertscrub and grassland sites. In contrast, evidence of episodic sub-root zone percolation and chloride profiles containing <250 yr of atmospheric deposition characterized the woodland site. The results suggested that the desertscrub and grassland areas support small upward fluxes across the water table (nonrecharge), whereas the woodland site supports significant downward fluxes across the water table (recharge). A nonrecharge-recharge transition was identified to be collocated with a grassland-woodland ecotone. The establishment of vegetation-recharge relationships such as this will improve estimates of basin-scale recharge by identifying regions where no recharge is expected and regions where recharge is expected and point measurements should be concentrated. An approach integrating remotely sensed spatial distributions of vegetation and indicator relationships to recharge is both timely and warranted, although several caveats, as revealed in this study, should be noted.

At a disturbed prairie remnant in central Ohio, the potential for hybridization was examined within sympatric populations of a rare prairie species, Asclepias sullivantii (Sullivant's milkweed), and the more widespread Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed). Measurements of eight leaf, 15 flower, and seven pollinarium traits showed the two species to be distinct in all but one trait, with putative hybrids exhibiting intermediate values for most characters. A multivariate analysis of the morphological traits showed the parental species separated in two-dimensional ordination space, with the hybrids situated between them. The parental taxa overlapped broadly in flowering time, peaking during the first week of July. Isozyme analysis of 30 individuals of each parental taxon and eight apparent hybrids revealed three variable loci, one of which included species-specific alleles that were both present in the hybrid. These results reinforce our hypothesis that the morphologically intermediate plants at this site are hybrids resulting from recent crossing between two genetically distinct species. Experimental interspecific hand-pollinations showed the potential for hybrid fruit set in A. syriaca (26% fruit set) but not A. sullivantii (0%), although fruit set was reduced compared with conspecific pollinations (63% and 13%, respectively). Hybrid pollinia were essentially inviable, but the observation of numerous naturally set fruits borne by hybrids indicates that they may not be evolutionary dead ends but could serve as bridges to gene flow between the species. This hybridization record is the first for this pair of species, and it reinforces recent suggestions that local hybridization between milkweeds is more common than previously stated.","Culley, T.M.; Klips, R.A.","","165",2004,"Asclepias sullivantii; Asclepias syriaca; Hybridization; Isozymes; Milkweed; Pollination","","","","","","","","",""

Successful restoration requires clearly defined objectives and the means to assess progress in meeting them. Often this includes monitoring population trajectories (changes in population size over time) of focal species. Unfortunately, population trajectories in and of themselves are often ambiguous and open to interpretation. Incorporation of additional information can increase the information content of such monitoring programs. Here we advocate using behavioral indicators, particularly the giving-up density (GUD) of food in experimental foraging patches, to complement more traditional monitoring programs that track changes in population sizes over time. We use the results of two field studies to demonstrate how GUDs reflect changes in environmental quality (background food abundance), changing physiological costs of maintenance over an annual cycle, and risk of predation. We then illustrate, through hypothetical examples, how knowledge of changes in GUDs over time can inform interpretation of actual population trajectories (based on 12 years of monitoring) of four bird species of conservation concern at the United States Forest Service Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois, USA. We conclude with a prospectus providing guidelines for incorporating behavioral indicators like the GUD in monitoring programs.

With the exception of a few pronounced dating anomalies, SOC radiocarbon age generally increases steadily with depth back to 10-15,000 cal yr BP, the deepest soil intervals in 9 of the 12 sites. The radiocarbon ages were used to establish the chronology of changes in past plant distribution over time and space, based on SOC δ13C as an indicator of C3 and C4 plant abundance. Changes were referenced to an SOC δ13C value of -20‰, which is the approximate mid-point between C3 and C4 carbon isotope composition, i.e., an equal mixture of C3 and C4 carbon. Prior to 10,000 cal yr BP, the region was dominated by C3 plants with the exception of the southernmost Texas sites. From 10,000 to 2000 cal yr BP, C4 plants expanded their range, initially as a peninsula of C4-predominant grasses extending northeastward and ultimately dominating all but the northernmost border of the region. Finally, the C3-predominant region re-expanded after 1000 cal yr BP, perhaps as a response to the Little Ice Age cooling. Despite uncertainties associated with using radiocarbon-dated SOC-depth profiles as a proxy, the past C3 and C4 plant distribution inferred from SOC δ13C conforms well to results from other paleoclimate proxies, and differences may be helpful in targeting future research. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Follett, R.F.; Kimble, J.M.; Leavitt, S.W.; Pruessner, E.G.","","162-163",2007,"","","","","","","","","",""

In the Great Basin of North America, seeds sown in the fall to restore degraded sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe plant communities may experience high mortality in winter due to exposure of seedlings to freezing temperatures and other stressors. Delaying germination until early spring when conditions are more suitable for growth may increase survival. We evaluated the use of BioNik™ (Valent BioSciences LLC) abscisic acid (ABA) to delay germination of bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata). Seed was either left untreated or coated at five separate rates of ABA ranging from 0.25 to 6.0 g 100 g−1 of seed. Seeds were incubated at five separate constant temperatures from 5 to 25°C. From the resultant germination data, we developed quadratic thermal accumulation models for each treatment and applied them to 4 years of historic soil moisture and temperature data across six sagebrush steppe sites to predict germination timing. Total germination percentage remained similar across all temperatures except at 25°C, where high ABA rates had slightly lower values. All ABA doses delayed germination, with the greatest delays at 5–10°C. For example, the time required for 50% of the seeds to germinate at 5°C was increased by 16–46 d, depending on the amount of ABA applied. Seed germination models predicted that the majority of untreated seed would germinate 5–11 weeks after a 15 October simulated planting date. In contrast, seeds treated with ABA were predicted to delay germination to late winter or early spring.

In this work, Holocene and Pleistocene sediments from an arid tropical region in Ethiopia have been analyzed for their phytolith content, presented as detailed counts and diagrams according to the Twiss classification. The aim is to test the usefulness of phytolith assemblages to indicate paleoenvironments at Middle Awash, where fossil pollen grains are poorly preserved in sediments that yielded abundant archaeological remains. The vegetation in the Middle Awash subdesertic valley is currently a shrub steppe dominated by C4 grasses adapted to arid conditions, with a narrow riparian forest limited to the Awash River. Our results show that modem surface samples, Holocene and Pleistocene sediments contain well-preserved and different phytolith assemblages, and therefore that no translocation processes from modem soil to geological strata seem to occur. Fossil records and modem assemblages are interpreted using phytolith ratios to estimate the density of the tree cover, the aridity and the proportion of C3 versus C4 grasses, as applied to phytolith assemblages from North America and West Africa. The phytolith assemblages from modem soil samples correctly reflect the proportion of trees and shrubs versus grasses, different in the riparian vegetation and the shrub steppe. Modem phytolith assemblages appear to be a mixed signature of local and regional vegetation. Phytolith analysis of the Holocene sample suggests a grassland, where the grass community is constituted by the Chloridoideae subfamily, adapted to warm and dry conditions and where C3-Pooideae cover the highlands. Phytolith analysis of the Pleistocene sample evidences grassland formation with scattered woody elements, where C4-Panicoideae grasses, adapted to warm and humid conditions dominate the grass cover.

Biostratigraphical correlation with North American Land Mammal Ages, plus some palaeomagnetic, isotopic and radiometric results, established the indirect connection with the international time scale. Under this biochronological framework, the compositional change of mammalian faunas and the evolution of major groups are discussed. Three stages are recognized in the Paleogene mammalian radiation: (1) the Paleocene flourishing of archaic groups, (2) the Eocene rising and development of modern major groups and (3) the Oligocene faunal reorganization. During the Paleocene, the mammalian radiation was dominated by the archaic groups and the faunas showed apparent endemism. The radiation was characterized by faunal turnovers due to the flourishing of different families in archaic groups. During this period, ancestral forms of modern glires emerged and the first Rodentiaformes appeared in the late Late Paleocene. Such faunal changes corresponded to the successive rise of temperature after the transition from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic. The Initial Eocene Thermal Maximum resulted in a significant decrease of the archaic groups and the faunal composition became more similar to that of modern ones. At the beginning of the Eocene, Artiodactyla and Euprimates appeared and Rodentia and Perissodactyla began to differentiate. During the Eocene, Mixodontia, Arctostylopidae, Dinocerata, Pantodonta, Tillodontia and Creodonta disappeared in succession. Perissodactyla became the dominant group in the faunas. The faunal turnovers were characterized by the alteration of dominant families due to the appearance, differentiation and flourishing of families in modern orders. The severe cooling events at the Eocene-Oligocene transition resulted in the development of open grassland, that further contributed to the great mammalian faunal turnover. The perissodactyl-dominant Eocene faunas were replaced by the rodent/lagomorph-dominant Oligocene faunas. The appearance and radiation of hypsodont mammal groups characterized the mammalian evolution in the Oligocene.

Cicada nymphs were collected from the C horizons of sandy Fluvents along the Kansas River east of Lawrence, Kansas. The nymphs appeared to be fifth instars, 13-17 mm long and 6-7 mm wide. Nymphs were placed in plastic enclosures containing layers of colored, moist, very fine-grained sand. They burrowed immediately, excavating air-filled, sediment-enclosed cells between 20 mm and 40 mm long and averaging 9 mm wide. Burrowing was completed in three stages: (1) sediment in the forward portion of the cell was excavated and rolled into a ball with the forelimbs; (2) the nymph turned 180° using a forward roll, and moved to the back of the cell; and (3) the sediment ball was pushed up against the back wall of the cell and kneaded with the forelimbs into a thin layer. Resulting burrow traces are sinuous and distinctly meniscate and demonstrate that insect larvae construct meniscate, backfilled burrows in well-drained terrestrial settings. Cicadetta calliope nymphs and their traces are excellent analogs for meniscate trace fossils commonly found in late Paleozoic-Cenozoic alluvial deposits and paleosols. Such meniscate trace fossils are useful for interpreting the paleoenvironment and paleohydrogeology of the units in which they are found. In addition, such backfilled burrows can be used to supplement the fossil record of cicada-like hemipterans, currently known only from the latest Permian to the Early Triassic.

In addition, many constituencies are looking to managed ecosystems to sequester carbon in plant biomass and soil C to reduce the impact of anthropogenic CO2 on climate. This work builds on a 90-year-old grazing experiment in mountain meadows on the Wasatch Plateau in central Utah. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of 90 years of protection from grazing on processes controlling the input, output, and storage of C in subalpine rangelands. Long-term grazing significantly reduced maximum biomass in all years compared with plots within grazing exclosures. For grazed plots, interannual variability in aboveground biomass was correlated with July precipitation and temperature (R2 = 0.51), while there was a weak correlation between July precipitation and biomass in ungrazed plots (R2 = 0.24). Livestock grazing had no statistically significant impacts on total soil C or particulate organic matter (POM), although grazing did increase active soil C and decrease soil moisture. Grazing significantly increased the proportion of total soil C pools that were potentially mineralizable in the laboratory, with soils from grazed plots evolving 4.6% of total soil C in 1 year while ungrazed plots lost 3.3% of total soil C. Volumetric soil moisture was consistently higher in ungrazed plots than grazed plots. The changes in soil C chemistry may have implications for how these ecosystems will respond to forecast climate change. Because grazing has resulted in an accumulation of easily decomposable organic material, if temperatures warm and summer precipitation increases as is anticipated, these soils may become net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere creating a positive feedback between climate change and atmospheric CO2.","Gill, R.A.","","60",2007,"Grazing exclosure; Hydrology; Mineralizable carbon; Soil carbon; Subalpine rangeland","","","","","","","","",""

However, such systems have been rarely documented at intercontinental scales. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis of multiple radiations in the genus Lupinus (Leguminosae), which exhibits some of the highest known rates of net diversification in plants. Given that incomplete taxon sampling, background extinction, and lineage-specific variation in diversification rates can confound macroevolutionary inferences regarding the timing and mechanisms of cladogenesis, we used Bayesian relaxed clock phylogenetic analyses as well as MEDUSA and BiSSE birth-death likelihood models of diversification, to evaluate the evolutionary patterns of lineage accumulation in Lupinus. We identified 3 significant shifts to increased rates of net diversification (r) relative to background levels in the genus (r = 0.18-0.48 lineages/myr). The primary shift occurred approximately 4.6 Ma (r = 0.48-1.76) in the montane regions of western North America, followed by a secondary shift approximately 2.7 Ma (r = 0.89-3.33) associated with range expansion and diversification of allopatrically distributed sister clades in the Mexican highlands and Andes. We also recovered evidence for a third independent shift approximately 6.5 Ma at the base of a lower elevation eastern South American grassland and campo rupestre clade (r = 0.36-1.33). Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions and BiSSE likelihood analyses of correlated diversification indicated that increased rates of speciation are strongly associated with the derived evolution of perennial life history and invasion of montane ecosystems. Although we currently lack hard evidence for ""replicate adaptive radiations"" in the sense of convergent morphological and ecological trajectories among species in different clades, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that iteroparity functioned as an adaptive key innovation, providing a mechanism for range expansion and rapid divergence in upper elevation regions across much of the New World. © 2012 The Author(s).","Drummond, C.S.; Eastwood, R.J.; Hughes, C.E.; Miotto, S.T.S.","","61",2012,"Adaptive radiation; ancestral state reconstruction; biogeography; diversification rates; incomplete sampling; key innovation","","","","","","","","",""

Due to this 'precocious hypsodonty' they have been considered to be the earliest grazers, suggesting an early spread of grassland in South America (at least 10 Myr earlier than in North America). This hypothesis is based on the idea that the abrasion of their hypsodont cheek teeth might have been caused by silica phytoliths which are abundant in a rich-in-grass diet. The analysis of the dental microwear pattern (using an optical stereomicroscope connected to a tri-CCD camera) of hypsodont notoungulates from the Late Oligocene Salla Beds of Bolivia revealed the preponderance of thin parallel scratches on the fossil teeth of most of the taxa analyzed, like extant grazers. This microwear pattern above all indicates predominant sub-horizontal jaw movements in the chewing behaviour of notoungulates with ""precocious"" hypsodonty. This signals shearing movements as in a diet rich in tough plants. This peculiar chewing pattern and/or a larger ingested proportion of grass phytoliths or exogenous grit are further discussed as hypothetical causes of increasing wear on notoungulate teeth during middle Cenozoic times. We particularly argue that the putative precocious spread of grasslands in South America traditionally linked with notoungulate hypsodonty is still far from being supported. Many questions arise concerning the development of hypsodonty within notoungulates and this case perfectly illustrates that the relations between high-crowned mammals and the source of tooth wear in the fossil record may not be straightforward. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Studies of the historical rise in lake level at Devils Lake have identified 1980 as a transition point between two such hydroclimatic modes. This study uses multiple datasets to characterize the mean hydroclimatological and hydrological conditions of these two climatic modes. Mode 1 is a cool and dry phase, and mode 2 is a warmer and wetter phase. Precipitation onto the lake increased by 24% from mode 1 to mode 2. This small, but sustained, increase produced significant changes in the mean hydroclimatic and hydrological states for the basin, including a 383% increase in surface run-off to the lake, and a 282% increase in the basin run-off ratio. Devils Lake Basin is located along a hydrotone (region of strong hydroclimatic gradients) where small changes in hydrological drivers are amplified into large changes in regional moisture. The effects of the fluctuating climatic modes and strong hydroclimatic gradients are probably further amplified by the unique fill–spill hydrology of the northern glaciated plains, which can result in nonlinear precipitation–run-off relationships. This natural pattern of extreme hydrological variations for Devils Lake produces enormous challenges for lake management. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","Todhunter, P.E.","","21",2016,"Devils Lake; hydroclimatic modes; run-off ratio; terminal lake; water budget","","","","","","","","",""

There has been much speculation about their age, but progress in dating cactus origins has been hindered by the lack of fossil data for cacti or their close relatives. Using a hybrid phylogenomic approach, we estimated that the cactus lineage diverged from its closest relatives ≈35 million years ago (Ma). However, major diversification events in cacti were more recent, with most species-rich clades originating in the late Miocene, ≈10-5 Ma. Diversification rates of several cactus lineages rival other estimates of extremely rapid speciation in plants. Major cactus radiations were contemporaneous with those of South African ice plants and North American agaves, revealing a simultaneous diversification of several of the world's major succulent plant lineages across multiple continents. This short geological time period also harbored the majority of origins of C4 photosynthesis and the global rise of C4 grasslands. A global expansion of arid environments during this time could have provided new ecological opportunity for both succulent and C4 plant syndromes. Alternatively, recent work has identified a substantial decline in atmospheric CO2 ≈15-8 Ma, which would have strongly favored C4 evolution and expansion of C4-dominated grasslands. Lowered atmospheric CO2 would also substantially exacerbate plant water stress in marginally arid environments, providing preadapted succulent plants with a sharp advantage in a broader set of ecological conditions and promoting their rapid diversification across the landscape.","Arakaki, M.; Christin, P.-A.; Edwards, E.J.; Eggli, U.; Lendel, A.; Moore, M.J.; Nyffeler, R.; Ogburn, R.M.; Spriggs, E.","","108",2011,"CAM photosynthesis; Climate change; Paleobotany","","","","","","","","",""

To have the best chance of successful long-term survival, restored populations should reflect the extant variation found in remnants, but restored sites may suffer from genetic bottlenecks as a result of founder effects. Kankakee Sands is a large-scale restoration being conducted by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in northwestern Indiana. Our goal was to test for loss of genetic variation in restored plant populations by comparing them with TNC's seed source nursery and with local remnant populations that were the source of nursery seed and of the first few restored sites. Allozyme analysis of Baptisia leucantha, Asclepias incarnata, Coreopsis tripteris, and Zizia aurea showed low levels of allozyme diversity within all species and reductions in polymorphism, alleles per locus, and expected heterozygosity between remnants and restorations for all species except A. incarnata . Almost all lost alleles were rare; restored populations contained almost 90% of alleles at polymorphic loci that occurred in remnants at frequencies greater than 1%. Allele frequencies for most loci did not differ between remnants and restored sites. Most species showed significant allele frequency differentiation among remnant populations and among restored sites.

Determining how the MPB has expanded its range to breach putative barriers, whether physical (nonforested prairie and high elevation of the Rocky Mountains) or climatic (extreme continental climate where temperatures can be below -40 °C), may contribute to our general understanding of range changes as well as management of the current epidemic. Here, we use a panel of 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess population genetic structure, connectivity, and signals of selection within this MPB range expansion. Biallelic SNPs in MPB from southwestern Canada revealed higher genetic differentiation and lower genetic connectivity than in the northern part of its range. A total of 208 unique SNPs were identified using different outlier detection tests, of which 32 returned annotations for products with putative functions in cholesterol synthesis, actin filament contraction, and membrane transport. We suggest that MPB has been able to spread beyond its previous range by adjusting its cellular and metabolic functions, with genome scale differentiation enabling populations to better withstand cooler climates and facilitate longer dispersal distances.

Sandstone beds of the Molina Member form sheet-like units interbedded with subordinate volumes of mudstone. The sandstones contain a low-diversity assemblage of sedimentary structures that is commonly dominated by horizontal, planar laminae, and bedding is locally contorted by large-scale soft-sediment deformation. A braided fluvial model best explains the characteristics of these strata, yet the existing braided-river models do not fully account for the assemblage of sedimentary structures or the relatively high volumes (up to half of the section) of interbedded mudstones. Two modern braided rivers, Medano Creek (Colorado) and the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River (Texas), have rapid, shallow flows that form horizontal, planar bedding. In both systems the presence of large volumes of easily mobilized sandy sediment, a flashy discharge regime, and a lack of reworking between flood stages lead to the development of high-energy, shallow-water bedforms and the preservation of the resulting high-energy sedimentary structures. Similar conditions and processes are suggested to have controlled deposition of the sand-dominated Molina Member, which is a depositional anomaly within the otherwise muddy Wasatch Formation. Short-term availability of readily eroded, second-cycle sandstones from a newly elevated source area to the southeast is the most likely reason for the abrupt change from a mud-dominated fluvial system to the sandy Molina system.","Lorenz, J.C.; Nadon, G.C.","","72",2002,"","","","","","","","","",""

This finding comes from a new fossiliferous locality at the municipality of San Dionisio Ocotepec, located in the Central Valleys region of the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. The associated fauna includes: Mammuthus columbi, Equus cf. E. conversidens, and Bison sp. By the presence of bison as well as mammoth, a Rancholabrean land mammal age (Late Pleistocene) is assigned to the fossil fauna. In addition, we performed a proboscidean mesowear analysis as well as a low magnification microwear analysis (35x) to the dental elements of the mammoth. Our findings suggest that the mammoth individual was a grazer. Due to the mammoth's feeding habits and the habitat described for Mexican samples of bison and horses, we concluded that during the Late Pleistocene, San Dionisio Ocotepec was dominated by open grassland in the lowlands.

A case study with the threatened plant, Silene spaldingii","Protecting genetic diversity throughout the range of a species is important for conservation, as doing so provides for long-term evolutionary potential and persistence under a changing environment. Conservation of diversity at the intraspecific level requires identification of all genetically distinct population segments within species; i.e., conservation units (CUs). Silene spaldingii occurs in grasslands of the Columbia Plateau region of western North America and is listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The recovery plan identified five physiographic regions across the range of the species to use as surrogates for genetic CUs. We collected leaf samples from an average of 26 plants from each of 19 of the largest populations across all five physiographic regions and used variable microsatellite and chloroplast DNA markers to determine how genetic variation is distributed across the range of the species and how well physiographic regions reflect population structure within this species. Results of several multivariate analyses clustered our samples into four genetic groups which did not correspond well with the physiographic regions. We observed little genetic differentiation among populations in the main range of the species which encompasses nearly all of four contiguous physiographic regions. However, three other distinct genetic groups were identified: two in the disjunct northeast corner and one at the southeast edge of the main range. Modification of the CUs to reflect the genetic groups rather than the physiographic regions would result in CUs which better reflect historical patterns of population structure. Moreover, use of the genetic units to inform translocation and genetic rescue efforts could improve our ability to mimic natural patterns of gene flow.

From the late-Pleistocene to early Holocene, the channel occupied by the San Bernardino Ciénega was largely aggradational with cobbles to sands being deposited in the oldest and deepest sediments. Changes in grain size indicate lowered stream power through the early to middle Holocene. Around 7200 years ago, sediments changed from sand and cobble dominance to significant proportions of silts and clays suggesting standing or still waters. Along with changes in sediment texture, preservation of organic material initiated, providing a record of regional and local vegetation change. The upland transitioned from woody/grassland co-dominance between 7000 and 5400. cal. BP, to grassland dominated conditions after 5400. cal. BP. Locally, wetland vegetation established within the stream channel after 7000. cal. BP and persisted until ca. 4100. cal. BP. From 4100 to ~2400. cal. BP, the ciénega remained stabilized, but was covered with grasses and forbs. Wetland vegetation returned after 2400. cal. BP. The change in sediment characteristics and inferred establishment of wetland vegetation is interpreted as increased importance of regional groundwater hydrology from the middle Holocene to present.

The type produced is determined by the reactive phases encountered during migration through the enclosing sediments. These include calcite, gypsum, and a clay substrate on which cation exchange occurs. CO2-charged soil waters undergo cation exchange reactions with solids of the enclosing sediments and dissolve calcite to saturation, yielding Ca-Mg-HCO3 groundwaters containing up to 700 mg·-L-1 total dissolved solids (TDS). More saline sulphate-rich groundwaters (1100-3000 mg·L-1 TDS) are produced through combined reaction with gypsum, calcite, and a Mg-rich exchange substrate. The type of groundwater produced is critically dependent upon the proportions of exchangeable cations on the bulk exchange substrate. Dissolution of gypsum increases SO4 of the solutions but much of the released Ca is taken onto the exchange substrate, displacing Na + K first then Mg. Continued gypsum dissolution causes precipitation of calcite and a decrease in solution pH. The resulting saline waters are enriched in Mg and Na (relative to Ca) compared with most groundwaters, and are enriched in SO4 relative to HCO3. Many sulphate-rich groundwaters common to the northern North American Prairies may have similar origins. Three solid phases (exchange substrate, calcite, and gypsum) are needed to model successfully these waters but interactions among them are complex. Calcite, for example, dissolves initially but is subsequently precipitated during evolution of sulphate-rich waters; consequently, changes to major dissolved constituents and carbon isotopic ratios are difficult to predict without a comprehensive understanding of the geochemical evolution of these waters. © 1993.","Cramer, J.J.; Nesbitt, H.W.","","57",1993,"","","","","","","","","",""

We also examined variation in sex expression (proportions of perfect and staminate flowers) within and among plants in populations of 16 species. The form of dichogamy was constant among congeners, with the exception of a few adichogamous selfers. The 17 protandrous genera included 11 native to both the Old and New Worlds and six endemic to the Americas. The protandrous genera were characterised by white flowers, the presence of stylopodia, decreasing proportions of staminate flowers in sequentially blooming umbels, wetter habitats, later flowering times, and eastern or transcontinental distributions. The 19 protogynous genera were all New World endemics characterised by mostly yellow or purple flowers, the absence of stylopodia, increasing proportions of staminate flowers in sequentially blooming umbels, drier habitats, earlier flowering times, and western distributions. The transition from protandry to protogyny probably occurred in the late Pliocene, coincident with adaptation to newly forming dry grassland and cold desert habitats. The evolutionary forces involved may have included selection for reproductive assurance, pollinator specialisation, or both.

Such groups exhibit genetic properties, or gene dynamics (i.e., changes in genetic correlations), that potentially facilitate the evolution of group cohesion and cooperation. When groups fission, changes in gene dynamics occur that might affect cooperation. The distribution of females among coalitions newly formed via fission also may promote reproductive success by alleviating intraspecific competition. Families of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), called coteries, were observed during a 15-year study at Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, and pedigrees of individuals were determined from livetrapping and electrophoretic analyses of paternity. We investigated the importance of coterie size, coterie density, and coancestry on the probability of fission; the effect of fissions on survivorship and territorial boundaries of coteries; and gene dynamics during and after fissions. Most new coteries occupied a subsection of the original territory. New coteries that contained a single female became extinct after about 1 year and their territories were usurped by adjacent coteries. Large coteries were more likely than smaller coteries to fission, but female coancestry within coteries usually did not influence the likelihood of fission, or the individuals that banded together in new groups. Members of new coteries interacted hostilely in the year after fission, but 1 or 2 generations elapsed before the new coteries became genetically distinct. We conclude that fission is probably driven by intraspecific competition within coteries rather than coancestry, and that coancestry does not explain the abrupt cessation of cooperation between individuals of the new coteries that result from fission. © 2007 American Society of Mammalogists.","Dobson, F.S.; Foltz, D.W.; Hoogland, J.L.; Manno, T.G.","","88",2007,"Coancestry; Competition; Cooperation; Cynomys ludovicianus; Dispersal; Fission; Gene dynamics; Kinship; Philopatry; Prairie dogs","","","","","","","","",""

We constrain advection in soils using the distribution of cosmogenic 7Be and weapons-derived isotopes, and quantify mixing with a steady-state model of vertical 210Pb transport. On a forested landscape in the Bega Valley in southeastern Australia and on grasslands in Marin County, California, where bioturbation is documented as the dominant sediment transport mechanism, we calculate diffusion-like mixing coefficients of 1-2 cm2 yr-1. In montane forest soils of northern New England, we observe little field evidence of short-term mixing, and find that the traditional advection-diffusion model fails to describe 210Pb profiles. Because nuclide profiles here can be described with a simple model of litterfall, organic matter decay, and radioactive decay, we argue that diffusion-like processes are barely active on short time scales, and that the advection-diffusion model overestimates diffusion-like transport. While animal bioturbation and soil freezing cycles have little effect on the fate of elements in New England, physical soil mixing drives transport at Bega Valley and Marin County.

Burrows of these organisms across a paleosol-eolian sand boundary in the Sand Hills indicate abrupt climate change during the transition from stabilized to active dune field and from humid to arid conditions. Medieval gophers tunneled at greater depths below the surface than do modern gophers, indicating the behavioral changes these animals underwent to survive during the transition. The gophers were likely surviving on roots remaining in the underlying soil as it was buried by sand; they tunneled >1 m up to the surface to deposit mounds of excavated soil and sand. Most of the burrows occur in areas of low-angle bedding, suggesting loss of vegetation occurred first on the crests of the newly formed dunes while vegetation persisted in the interdunes. Optically stimulated luminescence dates from a dune containing ancient gopher burrows are nearly identical throughout the height of the dune, indicating rapid accumulation of sand. As accumulation of sand was rapid, vegetative loss must also have occurred quickly, though not in a uniform pattern across the region.

The temporal overlap between the monitoring and paleolimnological time series provides an opportunity to assess coherence between the data sources. Diatom assemblages in the sediment core show that eutrophic conditions were present for at least 150 years. Monitored water chemistry data since the early 1980s show that total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) has increased by approximately 50% since the early 1990s, whereas concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) have remained stable. Further, measured TKN is significantly correlated to measurements of chlorophyll a over the monitoring period and to diatom-inferred TKN values, suggesting nitrogen limitation in Baptiste Lake. In contrast, measured TP was not correlated to chlorophyll a or diatom-inferred TP. Changes in land use over the past 100 years is the most parsimonious explanation for the nutrient changes.

We summarize the literature on fire history (fire rotation and fire return intervals) and past Native American burning practices to estimate past fire occurrence by vegetation type. Once past fire intervals were established they were divided into the area of each corresponding vegetation type to arrive at estimates of area burned annually. Finally, the First Order Fire Effects Model was used to estimate emissions. Approximately 1.8 million ha burned annually in California prehistorically (pre 1800). Our estimate of prehistoric annual area burned in California is 88% of the total annual wildfire area in the entire US during a decade (1994-2004) characterized as ""extreme"" regarding wildfires. The idea that US wildfire area of approximately two million ha annually is extreme is certainly a 20th or 21st century perspective. Skies were likely smoky much of the summer and fall in California during the prehistoric period. Increasing the spatial extent of fire in California is an important management objective. The best methods to significantly increase the area burned is to increase the use of wildland fire use (WFU) and appropriate management response (AMR) suppression fire in remote areas. Political support for increased use of WFU and AMR needs to occur at local, state, and federal levels because increasing the spatial scale of fire will increase smoke and inevitability, a few WFU or AMR fires will escape their predefined boundaries. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, processes for accurate land-cover classification over large regions are still evolving. We identified inconsistencies in the National Land Cover Dataset 1992, the most current and available representation of land cover for the conterminous United States. We also report means to address these inconsistencies in a bird-habitat model. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to position a regular grid (or lattice) over the upper midwestern United States and summarized the proportion of individual land covers in each cell within the lattice. These proportions were then mapped back onto the lattice, and the resultant lattice was compared to satellite paths, state borders, and regional map classification units. We observed mapping inconsistencies at the borders between mapping regions, states, and Thematic Mapper (TM) mapping paths in the upper midwestern United States, particularly related to grassland-herbaceous, emergent-herbaceous wetland, and small-grain land covers. We attributed these discrepancies to differences in image dates between mapping regions, suboptimal image dates for distinguishing certain land-cover types, lack of suitable ancillary data for improving discrimination for rare land covers, and possibly differences among image interpreters. To overcome these inconsistencies for the purpose of modeling regional populations of birds, we combined grassland-herbaceous and pasture-hay land-cover classes and excluded the use of emergent-herbaceous and small-grain land covers. We recommend that users of digital land-cover data conduct similar assessments for other regions before using these data for habitat evaluation. Further, caution is advised in using these data in the analysis of regional land-cover change because it is not likely that future digital land-cover maps will repeat the same problems, thus resulting in biased estimates of change.","Fox, T.J.; Gallant, A.L.; Knutson, M.G.; Suárez, M.J.; Thogmartin, W.E.","","32",2004,"Accuracy assessment; Geographic Information System; Land cover; NLCD; National Land Cover Dataset; Observer differences; Remote sensing","","","","","","","","",""

Engelm.]","RAPD markers provide a powerful tool for the investigation of genetic variation in natural and domesticated populations. Recent studies of strain/cultivar identification have shown extensive RAPD divergence among, but little variation within, inbred species or cultivars. In contrast, little is known about the pattern and extent of RAPD variation in heterogeneous, outcrossing species. We describe the population genetic variation of RAPD markers in natural, diploid sources of dioecious buffalograss [Buchloë dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm.]. Buffalograss is native to the semi-arid regions of the Great Plains of North America, where it is important for rangeland forage, soil conservation, and as turfgrass. Most sources of buffalograss germplasm are polyploid; diploid populations are previously known only from semi-arid Central Mexico. This is the first report of diploids from humid Gulf Coastal Texas. These two diploid sources represent divergent adaptive ecotypes. Seven 10-mer primers produced 98 polymorphic banding sites. Based on the presence/ absence of bands, a genetic distance matrix was calculated. The new Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) technique was used to apportion the variation among individuals within populations, among populations within adaptive regions, and among regions. There was considerable variation within each of the four populations, and every individual was genetically distinct. Even so, genetic divergence was found among local populations. Within-population variation was larger and among-population variation smaller in Mexico than in Texas. The largest observed genetic differences were those between the two regional ecotypes. These patterns of genetic variation were very different from those reported for inbred species and provide important baseline data for cultivar identification and continuing studies of the evolution of polyploid races in this species. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Huff, D.R.; Peakall, R.; Smouse, P.E.","","86",1993,"AMOVA; Buffalograss; Population genetic variation","","","","","","","","",""

I conducted a pollen addition and exclusion experiment demonstrating that style persistence signifies pollen limitation in the narrow-leaved purple coneflower Echinacea angustifolia, a species native to the North American prairie and plains. I developed a measure of style persistence, SP, a novel way to quantify pollen limitation in individual plants during the flowering season. Using this measure, I investigated the relationship between pollen limitation and seed set over two years in 19 and 27 natural remnant populations in an agricultural landscape. Population mean rates of seed set per plant varied from 0% to 54% in 1997 and from 0% to 63% in 1998. I found that pollen limitation reduced annual reproductive fitness within and among the populations studied. An analysis of the relationship between floret production and the rate of seed set provided no evidence that resource limitation influenced the rate of seed set. I estimated annual fecundity per plant as the product of the rate of seed set per floret, a pollen-limited process, and floret production per plant, likely a resource-limited process. Population means of individual annual fecundity ranged from 0 to 182 in 1997 and from 0 to 156 in 1998 and were predicted by population means of SP and the rate of seed set, but not by floret production. The effect of pollen limitation, as quantified by SP, overrides the strong, fundamental relationship between fecundity and floret production. This finding shows that populations consisting of large plants with large floral displays do not necessarily produce more seeds per plant.","Wagenius, S.","","165",2004,"Echinacea; Fecundity; Pollen limitation; Pollination; Prairie; Reproductive success; Style persistence","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike cheetahs, however, pronghorn antelope are distance runners rather than sprinters, and can run 11 km in 10 min, an average speed of 65 km h-1 (ref. 1). We measured maximum oxygen uptake in pronghorn antelope to distinguish between two potential explanations for this ability: either they have evolved a uniquely high muscular efficiency (low cost of transport) or they can supply oxygen to the muscles at unusually high levels. Because the cost of transport (energy per unit distance covered per unit body mass) varies as a predictable function of body mass among terrestrial vertebrates, we can calculate the predicted cost to maintain speeds of 65 and 100 km h-1 in an average 32-kg animal3. The resulting range of predicted values, 3.2-5.1 ml O2 kg-1 s-1, far surpasses the predicted maximum aerobic capacity4 of a 32-kg mammal (1.5 ml O2 kg-1s-1).

The stratigraphic history was temporally constrained by radiocarbon dating, whereas the ecology of C4 plants was inferred by stable carbon isotopes from buried soils. Environmental relationships within the Casas Grandes and San Pedro River basins of the Juanaquena study area provide a picture of evolving landscapes where fluvial behavior is driven by climate change and ecosystem instability. Seven periods of flood-plain construction and six episodes of paleosol formation and channel erosion occurred during the last 14,000 14C yr B.P. In the latest Pleistocene, channel erosion ensued in response to a general warming trend and landscape instability, although C3 plants still dominated in the alluvial valleys. In the Holocene when C4 plants began to dominate, channel erosion was typically initiated by a shift from relatively warmer and drier to cooler and wetter climates. The timing of erosion events exhibits a remarkable correlation to arroyo formation and paleosol formation of ephemeral streams in the North American southwest. In contrast to arroyos, the Casas Grandes and San Pedro Rivers created flood plains having mixed to bedload meanderbelts that persisted throughout the late Quaternary. However, bedrock valley constrictions accelerated flood-plain building, leading to periodic channel avulsion. Although intervals of landscape instability occurred numerous times in the late Quaternary, fluvial style was largely governed by the dominance of C4 grasslands, which appears to have maintained sufficient upland vegetative cover to mitigate flash flooding typical of arid environments.","Nordt, L.","","115",2003,"Alluvial stratigraphy; Climate; Grassland; Late Quaternary; Mexico; Paleosol","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, the CLM3 soil hydrology scheme has been replaced with the scheme used in the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC). While the modified model incorporates VIC soil hydrology, the original model structure in CLM3 is unchanged in most other respects, such as the representation of vegetation and its controls on surface energy exchanges. The modified version of CLM3 makes direct use of VIC soil parameters that have been developed for off-line regional, continental, and global simulations. The performance of the new model and CLM3 are evaluated through a comparison with observations at three flux tower sites: ABRACOS, a pasture clearing in the Brazilian rain forest, HAPEX-MOBILHY, a midlatitude agricultural site in France, and Valdai, a midlatitude grassland in Russia, as well as two large river basins (Arkansas-Red and Colorado in the United States). Overall, the results show that the merged model better reproduces observed soil hydrological variability, in particular, the seasonal evolution and amplitude of soil moisture, as compared to CLM3. The river basin simulations show that in the merged model, total runoff is generally less than in CLM3 and better agrees with observations. Owing to the interaction of runoff and soil moisture, the simulation of total evapotranspiration (or latent heat) is also improved in the merged model.

This study compares β diversities between the Great Basin and the Great Plains of the western USA over the last 17 Myr. Today, the Great Basin is a topographically diverse desert scrubland to woodland and the Great Plains are low-relief temperate grassland, but 17 Ma they were more similar in topography, climate and land cover. A georeferenced database of mammal occurrences, complied from several sources, is used to test two hypotheses for the elevation of Great Basin β diversity: (1) that tectonic change of the topography has driven increased habitat packing in high- and low-elevation habitats, and (2) that climatic cycling in the Pleistocene has driven faunas from neighbouring provinces to overlap in the region. Location: The Great Basin of the USA, centred on Nevada, and the central Great Plains of the USA, centred on Nebraska. Methods: Mammalian faunal lists compiled from published records and the records of many museums, available online, were partitioned into time-slices ranging from the recent to 17 Myr old. Beta diversity was calculated for each time-slice in two ways: multiplicative β diversity using first-order jackknife richness, and additive beta diversity using Simpson's evenness. Results: Beta diversity is elevated in Nevada relative to Nebraska today. Beta diversity has been higher in the Great Basin since the Pleistocene and possibly since the late Early Hemphillian (c. 7 Ma). Beta diversity in the Late Barstovian (c. 13.5 Ma) of the Great Plains was higher even than β diversity in the Great Basin of today. Main conclusions: The elevated β diversity in the Hemphillian supports the tectonic change hypothesis. The patterns of β diversity in the Recent, Pleistocene and Hemphillian all suggest that local-scale processes are important. The β diversity of the Late Barstovian Great Plains supports other studies indicating increased primary productivity or species packing. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Davis, E.B.","","14",2005,"Alpha diversity; Beta diversity; Climate change; Desert ecosystem; Gamma diversity; Great Basin; Great Plains; Palaeoecology; Tectonic change","","","","","","","","",""

Given the expansive areas of rangelands, how rangelands respond to climatic variation, management, and soil potential is important to understanding carbon dynamics. Rangeland carbon fluxes associated with Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) were measured from multiple year data sets at five flux tower locations in the Northern Great Plains. These flux tower measurements were combined with 1-km2 spatial data sets of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), temperature, precipitation, seasonal NDVI metrics, and soil characteristics. Flux tower measurements were used to train and select variables for a rule-based piece-wise regression model. The accuracy and stability of the model were assessed through random cross-validation and cross-validation by site and year. Estimates of NEE were produced for each 10-day period during each growing season from 1998 to 2001. Growing season carbon flux estimates were combined with winter flux estimates to derive and map annual estimates of NEE. The rule-based piece-wise regression model is a dynamic, adaptive model that captures the relationships of the spatial data to NEE as conditions evolve throughout the growing season. The carbon dynamics in the Northern Great Plains proved to be in near equilibrium, serving as a small carbon sink in 1999 and as a small carbon source in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Patterns of carbon sinks and sources are very complex, with the carbon dynamics tilting toward sources in the drier west and toward sinks in the east and near the mountains in the extreme west.

Sampling sites were selected on major geomorphic units with similar slope and aspect in three soil temperature regimes and three soil moisture regimes within the historic grasslands in US Great Plains and Western Corn Belt. Soil samples were collected from approximate 0- to 5- and 5- to 10-cm (A1 and A2 profile) depths and by genetic soil horizon thereafter in pits dug by backhoe or by hand to ∼2 m depth. Bulk density and soil texture were determined. Sieved, handpicked, and delimed subsamples of soil from each horizon were analyzed for total soil organic carbon (SOC) and δ13C and 14C dated (as mean residence time of SOC in calendar yr B.P.). Data from some sites support that major aeolian movement of soil occurred during the Holocene, often coincidental with literature reports of long periods of drought. However, soil profiles provide a low-resolution record of drought and/or wetter climatic conditions and thus time frames are general. Measurement of SOC age and δ13C signature in soil horizons was related to preboreal warming during entry into the Holocene. An important question raised by our data but requiring further confirmation by other studies is the timing of the peak of the Medieval Warm Period that is reported to have occurred prior to commencement of climate cooling that preceded the Little Ice Age. Based on δ13C, our data indicate a change from C 4 plants to increasing C3 plant dominance (as a surrogate of cooler temperature) at ∼1,500 yr B.P., whereas the reported start of the Little Ice Age is ∼600 yr B.P. In summary, the approach we used holds promise as an additional proxy for evaluating prior climate back thousands of years, but additional measurements besides those from the isotopes of C will be needed.","Follett, R.F.; Kimble, J.; Leavitt, S.W.; Pruessner, E.","","169",2004,"Climate change; Holocene; Soil organic carbon dating; Soil profile horizons; US Great Plains","","","","","","","","",""

Two often untested assumptions of these models, however, are that species traits can reliably predict species' broadscale distribution and that the effects of traits on community membership do not vary between restored and remnant habitats. The goals of this study were to determine whether combinations of ecological traits predispose moth species toward recolonization of restored prairies and to assess the degree to which restored prairies contain moth assemblages comparable with prairie remnants. In 2004, we collected 259 moth species from 13 tallgrass prairie remnants and restorations in central Iowa. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify significant combinations of ecological traits that were shared by groups of moth species. Logistic regression was then employed to test for significant effects of the trait combinations on the frequency of prairie sites occupied by moth species. PCA partitioned moth traits into four axes that explained a total of 81.6% of the variance. Logistic regression detected significant effects for all four PCA axes on the fraction of sites occupied by moths. Species frequently filtered from the regional species pool into prairies were those that had long flight periods and were multivoltine, displayed a feeding preference for legumes but not other forb families, and were regionally abundant but relatively small in body size. Ordination revealed significant differences in moth communities among prairies, suggesting that species traits and habitat characteristics likely interact to create observed patterns of species recolonization of restorations. Thus, the optimal approach to restoring the lepidopteran fauna of tallgrass prairies may involve locating prairie plantings adjacent to habitat remnants. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Conoan, C.J.; Steichen, R.M.; Summerville, K.S.","","16",2006,"Assembly rules; Biodiversity; Moths; Principal components analysis; Restoration ecology; Tallgrass prairie; Trait-filter models","","","","","","","","",""

We review hypotheses regarding maintenance and transmission of Y. pestis, emphasizing recent data from North America supporting maintenance by persistent transmission that results in sustained non-epizootic (but variable) rates of mortality in hosts. This maintenance mechanism may facilitate periodic epizootic eruptions ""in place"" because the need for repeated reinvasion from disjunct sources is eliminated. Resulting explosive outbreaks that spread rapidly in time and space are likely enhanced by synergistic positive feedback (PFB) cycles involving flea vectors, hosts, and the plague bacterium itself. Although PFB has been implied in plague literature for at least 50 years, we propose this mechanism, particularly with regard to flea responses, as central to epizootic plague rather than a phenomenon worthy of just peripheral mention. We also present new data on increases in flea:host ratios resulting from recreational shooting and poisoning as possible triggers for the transition from enzootic maintenance to PFB cycles and epizootic explosions. Although plague outbreaks have received much historic attention, PFB cycles that result in decimation of host populations lead to speculation that epizootic eruptions might not be part of the adaptive evolutionary strategy of Y. pestis but might instead be a tolerated intermittent cost of its modus operandi. We also speculate that there may be mammal communities where epizootics, as we define them, are rare or absent. Absence of plague epizootics might translate into reduced public health risk but does not necessarily equate to inconsequential ecologic impact. © 2019 Biggins and Eads.","Biggins, D.E.; Eads, D.A.","","6",2019,"Enzootic; Epizootic; Feedback; Flea; Plague; Rodent; Yersinia pestis","","","","","","","","",""

We selected, a priori, three species pairs consisting of species that are morphologically and taxonomically similar and may therefore be likely to engage in interspecific, consumptive competition. We then examined a large-scale database of snake detection/nondetection data and used occupancy modelling to determine whether these species occur together more or less frequently than expected by chance while accounting for variation in detection probability among species and incorporating important habitat categories in the models. For some snakes, we obtained evidence that the probabilities that habitat patches are used are influenced by the presence of potentially competing congeneric species. Specifically, timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) were less likely than expected by chance to use areas that also contained eastern diamond-backed rattlesnakes (Crotalus adamanteus) when the proportion of evergreen forest was relatively high. Otherwise, they occurred together more often than expected by chance. Complex relationships were revealed between habitat use, detection probabilities and occupancy probabilities of North American racers (Coluber constrictor) and coachwhips (Coluber flagellum) that indicated the probability of competitive exclusion increased with increasing area of grassland habitat, although there was some model uncertainty. Cornsnakes (Pantherophis guttatus or Pantherophis slowinskii) and ratsnakes (Pantherophis alleghaniensis, Pantherophis spiloides, or Pantherophis obsoletus) exhibited differences in habitat selection, but we obtained no evidence that patterns of use for this species pair were influenced by current interspecific interactions. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that competitive interactions influence snake assemblage composition; the strength of these effects was affected by landscape-scale habitat features. Furthermore, we suggest that current interspecific interactions may influence snake occupancy, challenging the paradigm that contemporary patterns of snake co-occurrence are largely a function of diet partitioning that arose over evolutionary time. © 2013 British Ecological Society.","Baxley, D.L.; Brock, J.C.; Craig Rudolph, D.; Gregory, B.B.; Guyer, C.; Jeffrey Humphries, W.; Lee, J.R.; Mcclure, C.J.W.; Pierce, J.B.; Smith, L.L.; Steen, D.A.; Stevenson, D.J.; Sutton, W.B.","","83",2014,"Co-existence; Coluber; Competition; Crotalus; Detection probability; Elaphe; Occupancy modelling; Pantherophis; Reptile; Sympatry","","","","","","","","",""

The Florida apple snail (Pomacea paludosa) has drawn attention as a critical prey item for wetlands wildlife and as an indicator of wetlands restoration success in peninsular Florida, USA. An apparent contradiction has evolved wherein this species appears intolerant of drying events, but these disturbances may be necessary to maintain suitable habitat structure for apple snails. We recently reported that assertions regarding intolerance to dry downs in this species were inaccurate. Here, we compared snail density in habitats with (wet prairie) and without (slough) emergent macrophytes, as well as evaluating the effects of structural attributes within the broad wet prairie habitat type. Snail densities were greater in prairies relative to sloughs (χ2= 12.90, df=1, P=0.0003), often by a factor of two to three. Within wet prairie habitats, we found greater snail densities in Panicum hemitomon as compared to Eleocharis cellulosa (χ2=31.45, df=1, P=0.0001). Significantly fewer snails were found in dense E. cellulosa as compared to habitats with lower stem density (χ2= 10.73, df=1, P=0.011). Our results indicate that wet prairie habitat supports greater snail densities than nymphaea-dominatd slough.

We conducted a mark-recapture study to directly quantify temporal and spatial variation in the phenotypic traits (sex, size, body condition) of snakes at the den itself, and those dispersing through woodland 50 m away. Captures of 909 snakes on the days they emerged, and 6653 snakes as they dispersed, revealed massive spatiotemporal heterogeneity in phenotypic traits among samples. Day-to-day variation in weather conditions affected numbers and sex ratios of emerging and dispersing snakes; for example, small females dispersed in greater numbers after unusually cold nights, when harassment by courting males was reduced. Most snakes stayed at the den only briefly (<5 days) prior to dispersal, so that sampling at the den itself (the only evidence available from most previous studies) underestimates the number of animals in the population, as well as the proportions of females, of small adult males and of juvenile animals. Overall, the heterogeneous and temporally dynamic distributions of phenotypic traits (such as sex and size) among our samples are predictable on the basis of the central roles of male-male competition and sexual conflict in the mating system of these snakes.

Major differences in mite assemblages were recorded between these soils, as well as between contrasting microhabitats within each soil type. In the medium-textured soil, richness and abundance of Acari taxa were related to soil organic carbon in the surface soil (0-1 cm), particularly for the Prostigmata. This relationship was not apparent in the heavy-textured soil where organic carbon content was considerably higher (4-9-5% cf. 0-4-1-75%). The highest densities on the medium-textured soil (c. 2600 m-2 dominated by Speleorchestes, Eupodes and Pseudocheylus spp.) were recorded in mulga groves where there was abundant surface litter. However these densities were greatly exceeded under annual grassland on the heavy-textured soil (c. 14,000 m-2, dominated by Afrotydeus spp.). These are amongst the highest mite densities recorded on semi-arid soils in Australia, possibly due to these grasslands being the least saline of the sites sampled in the chenopod shrublands. Broad similarities in microarthropod composition at family and generic levels in similar ecosystems in Australia and North America suggest either convergent evolution under similar selection pressures or long distance dispersal in the past.

In particular, to assess the exposure of terrestrial biomes and ecoregions to climate-related risks during the Holocene-Anthropocene transition starting at the pre-industrial period. Location: Terrestrial ecosystems of the Earth. Methods: We calculated long-term climate differences (anomalies) between the mid-Holocene (6 ka cal bp, mH), pre-industrial conditions and projections for 2100 (middle-strength A1B scenario) using six global circulation models available for all periods. Climate differences were synthesized with multivariate statistics and average principal component loadings of temperature and precipitation differences (an estimate of climate-related risks) were calculated on 14 biomes and 766 ecoregions. Results: Our results suggest that most of the Earth's biomes will probably undergo changes beyond the mH recorded levels of community turnover and range shifts because the magnitude of climate anomalies expected in the future are greater than observed during the mH. A few biomes, like the remnants of North American and Euro-Asian prairies, may experience only slightly greater degrees of climate change in the future as compared with the mH. In addition to recent studies that have identified equatorial regions as the most sensitive to future climate change, we find that boreal forest, tundra and vegetation of the Equatorial Andes could be at greatest risk, since these regions will be exposed to future climates that are well outside natural climate variation during the Holocene. Conclusions: The Holocene-Anthropocene climate transition, even for a middle-strength future climate change scenario, appears to be of greater magnitude and different from that between the mH and the pre-industrial period.

The problem suggests a complex interaction of social and ecological drivers that are not well understood. Using the Chihuahuan Desert grasslands of the Janos Biosphere Reserve of northern Mexico as a case study, we sought to understand the social–ecological context that shaped landscape change. Our approach included a synthesis of the historical literature and interviews with local residents, with the goal of facilitating long-term grassland restoration. Findings indicate that recent changes in Chihuahuan Desert grasslands are likely related to the co-occurrence of heavy grazing, fire suppression, and the elimination of key species, including prairie dogs and native ungulates. Local residents widely perceive both fire and prairie dogs to be destructive to grasslands and livelihoods. Over the last 50 years, evolving land tenure policies have fragmented the landscape into smaller parcels which typically produce an insufficient livelihood from cattle despite high stocking rates. Declining cattle profitability has motivated the sale and conversion of rangelands to more profitable croplands irrigated with groundwater. Since the founding of the Janos Biosphere Reserve in 2009, universities, local cattle operators, conservation organizations, and federal agencies have begun collaborating on restoration activities. While complete restoration of grasslands is unlikely, progress appears possible largely because of the willingness of local residents to try new management practices that may improve their ability to benefit from the land. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Hruska, T.; Sierra-Corona, R.; Solis-Gracia, V.; Toledo, D.","","218",2017,"Ejido; Grazing; Land use change; Mexico; Restoration; Shrub encroachment","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis of well-preserved bone collagen from a variety of body elements was used to determine the trophic relationships among these herbivores. A range of δ15N values was observed with ruminants and non-ruminants clustering into two distinct groups. Analysis of a young mammoth revealed a relatively high δ15N composition, which is consistent with a milk-dominated diet and supports the previously noted ""juvenile effect"" observed in the isotopic analyses of sub-adult mammals. In addition, the isotopic evidence supports the view that a giant ground sloth was primarily herbivorous, as opposed to competing hypotheses for an omnivorous or carnivorous nature. The measured 13C abundances across the range of mammals, and of fossil organic matter, indicate a lack of C-4 grasses in the regional environment and a reliance on C-3 vegetation by all herbivores included in this study. These findings may record a regional geographic transition between C-3 and C-4 dominated grasslands. However, the overlapping isotopic signatures may also be considered as a potential indicator of extreme competition amongst the basal herbivores in this ecosystem, which has broader implications for the subsequent mass extinction of mega-herbivore clades at the end of the Pleistocene epoch. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Mammoths, camels, and lions walked the ground that has become our cities and streets. Then, just as the first humans reached the Americas, these Ice Age giants vanished forever. In this book the author digs through the evidence surrounding Pleistocene large animal (""megafauna"") extinction events worldwide, showing that understanding this history-and our part in it-is crucial for protecting the elephants, polar bears, and other great creatures at risk today. These surviving relatives of the Ice Age beasts now face an intensified replay of that great die-off, as our species usurps the planet's last wild places while driving a warming trend more extreme than any in mammalian history. Inspired by a passion for the lost Pleistocene giants, some scientists advocate bringing wolves back to Scotland, and elephants to America's Great Plains as stand-ins for their extinct native brethren. By reintroducing big browsers and carnivores to colder climes, they argue, we could rescue some of the planet's most endangered animals while restoring healthy prairie ecosystems. Critics, including biologists enmeshed in the struggle to restore native species see the proposal as a dangerous distraction from more realistic and legitimate conservation efforts. Navigating competing theories and emerging evidence, the book examines the extent of human influence on megafauna extinctions past and present, and explores innovative conservation efforts around the globe. The key to modern-day conservation, the author suggests, may lie fossilized right under our feet. © 2011 by Sharon Levy.

We measured postmetamorphic body size for 4 species (Spea multiplicata, S. bimbifrons, Bufo cognalus, Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium) and 3 age classes (metamorph, subadult, adult) of amphibians captured at playa wetlands surrounded by one of 2 general land-use types (cultivation, grassland) in the Southern High Plains. Sixteen playas (4 per land-use type in 1999 and 2000) were partially enclosed with driftfence and pitfall traps, and mass and snout-vent length (SVL) were measured from a subsample of captured individuals. Mass and SVL were 10-148% greater for amphibians captured at grassland wetlands than at cropland wetlands for most species and age classes. Mass and SVL also were 3-124% greater in 1999 than in 2000 for most species and age classes. We attribute differences in body size between land-use types to differences in the hydroperiods of the associated wetlands, and potentially to variation in the density of terrestrial conspecifics and aquatic predators. We attribute differences in body size between years to differences in rainfall. Body size is positively related to the probability of survival, reproduction, and evolutionary fitness in amphibians. Thus, if cultivation of landscapes surrounding wetlands negatively influences postmetamorphic body size of amphibians, restoration of native grasslands surrounding playa wetlands may help prevent local amphibian declines.","Gray, M.J.; Smith, L.M.","","69",2005,"Agriculture; Amphibians; Body size; Conservation; Southern High Plains; Wetlands","","","","","","","","",""

While fossil plant specimens from the Miocene Dove Spring Formation of California as well as data from phylogenetic studies and molecular clocks show that C4 grasses evolved prior to the RICE, most isotopic data from paleosols and mammal tooth enamel suggest that its abundance on the landscape was minimal. However, a few recent studies from the Great Plains suggest that C4 grasslands may have been more prominent prior to the RICE event. Here we examine stable carbon isotope values from ungulate tooth enamel from the Barstow Formation of southern California, which is geographically and temporally close to the Dove Spring Formation, and records a diverse and abundant paleofauna of medial Miocene age. Tooth enamel δ13C values were examined in seven ungulate genera including the hypsodont equids; Acritohippus sp. and Scaphohippus sp.; the camelids, Aepycamelus sp., Hesperocamelus sp., and Procamelus sp.; the antilocaprid, Merycodus sp.; and the proboscidean, Gomphotherium sp. More positive δ13C values observed within the equids, camelids, and antilocaprids are suggestive of C4 grasses being included in the diets of these taxa. The equids exhibited the most positive mean δ13C values, which indicate a higher component of dietary C4 grasses (up to 18%) when compared to the other sampled ungulate taxa. The tooth enamel isotope values presented in this study show the presence of C4 grasses as a significant component of ungulate diets millions of years before the RICE. The abundance of C4 plants earlier in the Miocene may imply a more significant role in the major ungulate diversification events than previously suspected. The few pre-RICE localities showing evidence of C4 abundance suggests that these grasslands were geographically restricted which limits, but may not exclude, the possibility that a world-wide mechanism controlled its spread. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Feranec, R.S.; Pagnac, D.","","388",2013,"Barstow Formation; C4 grasses; Carbon isotopes; Equidae; Miocene; Ungulates","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we evaluate sediment yields from the Western Transverse Ranges of California in an attempt to explain why they are two- to tenfold greater than the surrounding areas of California. We found that suspended-sediment yields across the gauged basins of the Western Transverse Range during 1969-1999 varied by approximately an order of magnitude (740-5300 t/km2/yr). Similarly, fine-sediment concentrations for normalized discharge rates varied by almost two orders of magnitude (e.g., 1.3-110 g/L for the mean annual flood) for 11 previously unmonitored drainages of the Santa Ynez Mountains. Areas with high sediment yields consistently have weakly consolidated bedrock (Quaternary-Pliocene marine formations) and are associated with the highest rates of tectonic uplift of the region (&gt;5 mm/yr). These regions are important to the sediment discharge budgets, because ∼50% of the total suspended-sediment discharge from the Western Transverse Range is estimated to be generated within these regions, even though they represent only ∼10% of the total watershed area. Previous estimates of suspended-sediment discharge from the Ventura River have likely been underestimated by ∼50% because the gauging station is located immediately upstream of a high sediment yield region. We also found a significant and positive correlation between sediment yield and the percentage of a watershed with grassland and agricultural land use. These results suggest that there is adequate variation within the lithology, tectonics, and land use of the broader Western Transverse Range geologic province to induce large variations in sediment yield at the local scale. © 2009 Geological Society of America.","Mertes, L.A.K.; Warrick, J.A.","","121",2009,"","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed MH sediments from West Olaf Lake (WOL) and Steel Lake (SL) in Minnesota to examine the effects of warm/dry climatic conditions on prairie-woodland ecosystems. Mineral composition and carbonate δ18O were used to determine climatic variations, whereas pollen assemblages, charcoal δ13C, and charcoal accumulation rates were used to reconstruct vegetation composition, C3 and C4 plant abundance, and fire. The ratio of aragonite/calcite at WOL and δ18O at SL suggest that pronounced droughts occurred during the MH but that drought severity decreased with time. From charcoal δ13C data we estimated that the MH abundance of C4 plants averaged 50% at WOL and 43% at SL. At WOL C4 abundance was negatively correlated with aragonite/calcite, suggesting that severe moisture deficits suppressed C4 plants in favor of weedy C3 plants (e.g., Ambrosia). As climate ameliorated C4 abundance increased (from ≈33 to 66%) at the expense of weedy species, enhancing fuel availability and fire occurrence. In contrast, farther east at SL where climate was cooler and wetter, C4 abundance showed no correlation with δ18O-inferred aridity. Woody C3 plants (e.g., Quercus) were more abundant, biomass flammability was lower, and fires were less important at SL than at WOL. Our results suggest that C 4 plants are adapted to warm/dry climatic conditions, but not to extreme droughts, and that the fire regime is controlled by biomass-climate interactions.","Brown, T.A.; Hu, F.S.; Nelson, D.M.; Stefanova, I.; Tian, J.","","101",2004,"","","","","","","","","",""

The grasslands of the Great Plains have supported the greatest number of bison (Bison bison; Linnaeus, 1758) since prehistoric times. We tested the hypothesis that body mass (BM, kg) and asymptotic body mass (ABM, kg) of Bison decline with rising temperature and increasing drought over both temporal and spatial scales along the Great Plains. Temporally, we modeled the relationship of annual measures of BM and height (H, m) of 5,781 Bison at Wind Cave National Park (WICA) from 1966 to 2015. We used Gompertz equations of BM against age to estimate ABM in decadal cohorts; both females and males decreased from the 1960s to the 2010s. Male ABM was variable but consistently larger (699 vs. 441 kg) than female ABM. We used local mean decadal temperature (MDT) and local mean decadal Palmer Drought Severity Index (dPDSI) to model the effects of climate on ABM. Drought decreased ABM temporally (−16 kg/local dPDSI) at WICA. Spatially, we used photogrammetry to measure body height (HE) of 773 Bison to estimate BME in 19 herds from Saskatchewan to Texas, including WICA. Drought also decreased ABM spatially (−16 kg/local dPDSI) along the Great Plains. Temperature decreased ABM both temporally at WICA (−115 kg/°C local MDT) and spatially (−1 kg/°C local MDT) along the Great Plains. Our data indicate that temperature and drought drive Bison ABM presumably by affecting seasonal mass gain.

In North America, eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) often colonizes prairies. Habitat management can focus on woody removal, but we often lack long-term data on whether removal leads to population recovery of herbaceous plants without seeding. We undertook a long-term study (17 years) of numbers of the rare annual plant Agalinis auriculata in a gridwork of 100 m2 plots in adjacent prairie and oldfield sites in Kansas, USA. We collected data before and after removal of Juniperus virginiana at the prairie. Plant population sizes were highly variable at both sites and over time. High numbers of plants in a plot 1 year were often followed by low numbers the following year, suggesting negative density-dependence. Plant numbers were lowest with extensive woody cover and with low precipitation. After woody plant removal, A. auriculata increased dramatically in abundance and occupancy in most years; increases were also seen at the oldfield, suggesting later survey years were overall more favorable. Synthesis and applications: Removal of woody plants led to increased numbers of a rare annual prairie plant, without seeding. Multiple years of data were essential for interpretation given extreme temporal variability in numbers. The largest prairie population was 7 years following tree removal, showing that positive effects of management can last this long. This species also fared well in oldfield habitat, suggesting restoration opportunities. Given that land managers are busy, time-efficient field methods and data analysis approaches such as ours offer advantages. In addition to general linear models, we suggest Rank Occupancy-Abundance Profiles (ROAPs), a simple-to-use data visualization and analysis method. Creation of ROAPs for sites before and after habitat management helps reveal the degree to which plant populations are responding to management with changes in local density, changes in occupancy, or both. © 2018 The Authors.

The species consists of two widespread polyploid races, with narrowly endemic diploid populations known from two regions: central Mexico and Gulf Coast Texas. We describe and compare the patterns of allozyme and RAPD variation in the two diploid races, using a set of 48 individuals from Texas and Mexico (four population samples of 12 individuals each). Twelve of 22 allozyme loci were polymorphic, exhibiting 35 alleles, while seven 10‐mer RAPD primers revealed 98 polymorphic bands. Strong regional differences were detected in the extent of allozyme polymorphism: Mexican populations exhibited more internal gene diversity (He= 0.20, 0.19) than did the Texan populations (He= 0.08, 0.06), although the number of RAPD bands in Texas (n= 62) was only marginally smaller than in Mexico (n= 68). F‐statistics for the allozyme data, averaged over loci, revealed strong regional differentiation (mean FRT=+ 0.30), as well as some differentiation among populations within regions (mean FPR=+ 0.09). In order to describe and compare the partitioning of genetic variation for multiple allozyme and RAPD loci, we performed an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA). AMOVA for both allozyme and RAPD data revealed similar qualitative patterns: large regional differences and smaller (but significant) population differences within regions. RAPDs revealed greater variation among regions (58.4% of total variance) than allozymes (45.2%), but less variation among individuals within populations (31.9% for RAPDs vs. 45.2% for allozymes); the proportion of genetic variance among populations within regions was similar (9.7% for RAPDs vs. 9.6% for allozymes). Despite this large‐scale concordance of allozyme and RAPD variation patterns, multiple correlation Mantel techniques revealed that the correlations were low on an individual by individual basis.

The precipitation regime of the climosequence spans a range between 144 and 86 cm/year, with moisture regimes classified as udic, udicustic, ustic, and aridic-ustic, in a general northeast to southwest direction. Other soil-forming factors, such as soil age (&lt;35-40 ka), parent material (fluviodeltaic Beaumont Formation of late Pleistocene age), landscape (low-relief coastal plain), and vegetation (prairie or mixed woody shrubs), are relatively constant across the climosequence. Climate-sensitive chemical proxies of MAP identified include dithionite citrate-extractable Fe (Fedith), acid oxalate-extractable Fe (Feoxal), CaCO3 equivalent (CaCO3equiv), S, and ammonium acetate-extractable Na, K, and Mg (Naacet, Kacet, and Mgacet, respectively), which vary across the climosequence because of differences in effective depths of leaching and intensity of wetting and drying cycles. These standard USDA wet-chemical climate proxies are related to bulk (oxide or element) chemistry of soils and paleosols measured using XRF, which supports the use of geochemical climate proxies for interpreting the paleoclimate records of paleoVertisols. Application of the chemical index of alteration minus potash (CIA-K) geochemical climofunction to late Mississippian paleosols from the Appalachian basin of the eastern U.S. demonstrates evidence for a shift from a lower to a higher MAP paleoclimate that is consistent with previous paleoclimate models and with observed morphological changes in the paleosols.

A variety of paleorecords indicate that the onset of prolonged dry conditions in this region occurred as rapidly as 300 yr during the early Holocene, with a subsequent increase in moisture occurring rapidly in the late Holocene. Here, we report a 9500 yr multiproxy sediment record from Deming Lake, Minnesota, USA, that demonstrates only subtle dynamics during rapid climate changes that caused vegetation in the catchment to shift among pine forest, open grassland, and deciduous forest. The most substantial changes in ecosystem properties immediately followed deglaciation of the landscape, formation of the lake, and initial development of pine forests. In contrast, there were only muted responses to pronounced mid-Holocene climate changes that caused vegetation in the catchment to switch from pine forest to open grassland (ca. 8000 yr B.P.), and then deciduous forest (ca. 5400 yr B.P.). The flux of organic and inorganic terrigenous material, the processing of carbon, and catchment erosion changed rapidly during the most recent shift at 3300 yr B.P. to the modern pine forest. These changes coincided with the onset of meromictic conditions that influenced internal lake dynamics. However, the terrestrial influence on the lake sedimentary record gradually diminished over time, indicating a trajectory of increasing catchment stabilization that was relatively impervious to dramatic regional climate changes. The relative complacency of the Deming Lake record during the late Holocene indicates relative resistance to abrupt climate change at later stages of ecosystem development. © 2013 Geological Society of America.","Lascu, I.; Leavitt, P.R.; McLauchlan, K.K.; Myrbo, A.","","125",2013,"","","","","","","","","",""

Salinity (i.e. sulphate concentration) of these wetland ponds has a profound effect on their ecological function. Despite the apparent lack of surface and subsurface outflow from the closed basins, and strong evaporative enrichment due to the dry climate, many of the closed-basin wetlands maintain moderate salinity (1-10gL-1 as total dissolved solids) instead of evolving into hyper-saline wetlands. The objective of this study is to characterize the surface and groundwater conditions of a typical saline wetland in Saskatchewan, Canada, quantify the surface and subsurface distribution of sulphate, and understand the processes controlling the wetland salinity. The analysis of sediment core samples and the electrical resistivity imaging of the wetland basin indicated a large mass (ca. 107kg) of subsurface sulphate, most of which is in the form of gypsum. In comparison, the sulphate dissolved in pond water was only 0.13×106kg at its maximum, indicating that only a small fraction of sulphate is in the pond water column at any given time. The analysis of a 19-year mass balance of the wetland pond showed that complex water-sediment exchange processes transfer sulphate from surface water to the underlying sediments during the drying phase of wetland, and transfer part of it back to surface water during the wetting phase. We hypothesize that this wet-dry cycle, repeated many times since the deglaciation of the region has allowed the subsurface sulphate to accumulate and maintained the moderate salinity of the wetland. © 2012 Crown Copyright and Elsevier B.V.","Hayashi, M.; Heagle, D.; Kamp, G.V.D.","","478",2013,"Gypsum; Prairie pothole; Resistivity imaging; Sediment-water exchange; Sulphate; Wetland hydrology","","","","","","","","",""

Alluvial stratigraphic sections were investigated along a steep bio-climatic gradient extending from the moist-subhumid forest-prairie border of the east-central Plains to the dry-subhumid and semi-arid shortgrass prairie of the west-central Plains. Radiocarbon ages indicate that most large streams were characterized by slow aggradation accompanied by cumulic soil development from ca. 11,500 to 10,000 14C yr B.P. In the valleys of some large streams, such as the Ninnescah and Saline rivers, these processes continued into the early Holocene. The soil-stratigraphic record in the draws of western Kansas indicates slow aggradation punctuated by episodes of landscape stability and pedogenesis beginning as early as ca. 13,300 14C yr B.P. and spanning the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. The development record of alluvial fans in western Kansas is similar to the record in the draws; slow aggradation was punctuated by multiple episodes of soil development between ca. 13,000 and 9000 14C yr B.P. In eastern Kansas and Nebraska, development of alluvial fans was common during the early and middle Holocene, but evidence shows fan development as early as ca. 11,300 14C yr B.P. Buried soils dating between ca. 12,600 and 9000 14C yr B.P. were documented in fans throughout the region. In stream valleys across the Central Plains, rapid alluviation after ca. 9000 14C yr B.P. resulted in deeply buried soils that may harbor Paleoindian cultural deposits. Hence, the paucity of recorded stratified Paleoindian sites in the Central Plains is probably related to poor visibility (i.e., deep burial in alluvial deposits) instead of limited human occupation in the region during the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene.

The herbaceous cover of these introduced grasses and forbs often creates an impenetrable thicket for small ground-dwelling vertebrates. Contrary to some earlier descriptions of upland habitat of the southern and western San Joaquin Valley as perennial grasslands, recent evidence suggests that most of this area was a desert vegetated by saltbush scrub with sparse cover of native annual grasses and forbs. Many of the small vertebrates that evolved in these habitats, some of which are listed as threatened or endangered, are desert-adapted. These species evolved in sparsely vegetated habitats and rely on open ground to forage and avoid predation. Preliminary research indicates that populations of giant kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ingens), San Joaquin kangaroo rats (D. nitratoides), San Joaquin antelope squirrels (Ammospermophilus nelsoni), and blunt-nosed leopard lizards (Gambelia sila), all listed as threatened or endangered, are affected negatively by thick herbaceous cover. This cover also may adversely affect several listed plant species. Removing anthropogenic disturbances does not reduce or eliminate these exotic plants. Fire is effective in reducing herbaceous cover but kills native saltbush and often is costly to implement or control. Although livestock may have contributed originally to habitat destruction and introduction of exotic plants, we believe that in some years, moderate to heavy grazing by livestock is the best way to decrease the dense cover created by these exotics. Recent decisions to decrease or eliminate livestock grazing on conservation lands without definitive studies of grazing in these habitats may lead to further declines of native species and possible local extinction of some listed plants and animals.","Germano, D.J.; Rathbun, G.B.; Saslaw, L.R.","","29",2001,"Conservation; Endangered species; Exotic plants; Livestock grazing","","","","","","","","",""

To understand fully Plio-Pleistocene hominin dispersals, that is the increasing geographic range of hominins, a number of interacting factors must be examined. The most important variables affecting the first hominin dispersals would have been environmental, and it is thus imperative that appropriate climatic and geographical factors are included in analyses of possible Plio-Pleistocene hominin expansions. As the Late Pliocene climate was substantially different from that of today the present model utilises the Pliocene Research Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping Middle Pliocene Paleoenvironmental Reconstruction: PRISM2 [Dowsett, H.J., Barron, J.A., Poore, R.Z., Thompson, R.S., Cronin, T.M., Ishman, S.E., Willard, D.A., 1999.

The combination of data from palaeoclimate reconstructions and existing archaeological and palaeontological sites sheds light on the 'Out of Africa 1' problem, suggesting that expansion of hominins out of Africa would have been most feasible from a palaeoclimatic perspective at and around the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. The model predicts that the most likely dispersal route out of Africa would have been through the Levantine region, but a lack of research in the region of the Bab el Mandeb Straits means that this alternative pathway should not be ignored. There is also a small possibility of dispersals across the Mediterranean Sea, but with expansion limited to the northern coastline. Further easterly expansion of the hominin range is likely to have occurred through the more northerly countries of central Asia: specifically Georgia, Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan. A hominin dispersal route thus existed from Africa, through central Asia, to China during the Plio-Pleistocene period following the grassland vegetation belt that was present in this region at the time. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Residents of Manitoulin distinguished the two species and reported the presence of ""square-tails"" and ""sharp-tails"" in the winter of 1932-1933. There is no specimen evidence or verbal reports that Northern Sharp-tailed Grouse reached Michigan during that irruption. Prairie Sharp-tailed Grouse were in the northern peninsula of Michigan by 1930. In 1941, Michigan Department of Natural Resources made a planting of 37 Prairie Sharp-tailed Grouse on Drummond Island. Thence they spread east and the first lek was found at the west end of Manitoulin Island in 1952. By 1960, these birds had virtually colonized the whole island. Development of a hybrid index from the morphology of specimens of skins and skeletons from Manitoulin indicated that more than 50% of all birds in the 1960s were hybrids. In Michigan, less than 1% of the birds necropsied or checked in hunters' bags were hybrid. It seems likely that ethological isolation broke down on Manitoulin Island. The booming display of the Prairie Chicken and the tail rattling display of the Sharp-tailed Grouse can be broken down into their component parts. They appear to be homologous to five discrete displays of the Spruce Grouse, grouped in different patterns in each of the two lek species. There was little hybridization between Prairie Sharp-tailed Grouse and Prairie Chickens that had lived sympatrically for thousands of years. Northern Sharp-tailed Grouse had probably never lived sympatrically with Prairie Chickens and the evolution of the perception of species distinctions may not have evolved to the point where hybridization was restricted to a rare event.","Lumsden, H.G.","","119",2005,"Behaviour; Greater Prairie Chicken; Hybrids; Manitoulin Island Ontario; Michigan; Sharp-tailed Grouse; Tympanuchus cupido; Tympanuchus phasianellus","","","","","","","","",""

Genetic architecture of three populations reciprocally planted along an environmental gradient in the great plains","Climate change will test the evolutionary potential of populations. Information regarding the genetic architecture within and among populations is essential for prediction of evolutionary outcomes. However, little is known about the distribution of genetic variation for relevant traits in natural populations or alteration of genetic architecture in a changing environment. In this study, pedigreed families from three populations of the annual prairie legume Chamaecrista fasciculata were reciprocally transplanted in three environments across a broad latitudinal range in the Great Plains. The underlying premise of this work is that northern populations will in the future experience climates similar to current-day climates further south. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability ranged from 0.053 to 0.481, suggesting the potential for evolutionary change is possible for most traits. In general, the northern population harbored less genetic variation and had lower heritability for traits than the southern population. This population also experienced large reductions in fitness, as measured by estimated lifetime fecundity, when raised in either the intermediate or the southern climate, whereas the difference between the intermediate and southern population was less extreme. For fecundity, the pattern of cross-environment additive genetic correlations was antagonistic to evolutionary change in four of six cases when native and nonnative sites were compared. Six additional antagonistic positive correlations were found for the rate of phenological development and leaf thickness. Overall, the data suggest that if climate changes as predicted, the northern population will face a severe evolutionary challenge in the future because of low heritabilities, cross-environment genetic correlations antagonistic to selection, and demographic instability due to lower seed production in a hotter and drier climate.","Etterson, J.R.","","58",2004,"Across-environment additive genetic correlation; Distribution of genetic variation; Genetic constraint; Global warming; Heritability","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a model which argues that the body sizes of Nearctic mammals were moulded by Cenozoic climate and vegetation changes. Following the early Eocene Climate Optimum, forests retreated and gave way to open woodland and savannah landscapes, followed later by grasslands. Many herbivores that radiated in these new landscapes underwent a switch from browsing to grazing associated with increased unguligrade cursoriality and body size, the latter driven by the energetics and constraints of cellulose digestion (fermentation). Carnivores also increased in size and digitigrade, cursorial capacity to occupy a size distribution allowing the capture of prey of the widest range of body sizes. With the emergence of larger, faster carnivores, plantigrade mammals were constrained from evolving to large body sizes and most remained smaller than 1 kg throughout the middle Cenozoic. We find no consistent support for either Cope's Rule or Bergmann's Rule in plantigrade mammals, the largest locomotor guild (n = 1186, 59% of species in the database). Some cold-specialist plantigrade mammals, such as beavers and marmots, showed dramatic increases in body mass following the Miocene Climate Optimum which may, however, be partially explained by Bergmann's rule.

These birds have evolved physiological and behavioral means of coping with such extremes, but ongoing changes to temperature and precipitation patterns are affecting their breeding phenology, reproductive success, and population growth rates. We examined how seasonal and daily weather conditions and habitat structure were associated with the nest survival of Arizona Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum ammolegus) in the semidesert and plains grasslands of southeastern Arizona, USA. The mean ± SE daily survival rate (DSR) of nests was 0.960 ± 0.006, corresponding to overall nest success of 46%. The previous season's precipitation, large rain events, and nest concealment were the most important factors explaining DSR. Grasshopper Sparrow nest survival decreased with a wetter previous growing season and with large rain events on previous days. Nests that were more concealed had lower survival rates. There was some evidence that nest survival was lower later in the nesting season. In addition, when nest concealment was included in models, there were positive but weak associations between other vegetation variables and DSR-nests with higher visual obstruction at the nest and nest plot scales, and nests that were farther from shrubs >2 m tall, showed higher survival rates. Predation was the major cause of nest failure, suggesting complex interactions among predation, precipitation, and nest concealment. Further, our findings suggest tradeoffs in the potential effects of future climate change on A. s. ammolegus.

The network was divided into five regional groups based on geography, tree species, and length of record: the eastern Rockies, northern Saskatchewan, central Manitoba, southern Manitoba, and northwestern Ontario. Regional tree-ring records are primarily related to summer moisture and drought conditions, and are less responsive to droughts caused by deficits in winter precipitation. These summer-sensitive data are not linearly related to major modes of climate variability, including ENSO and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), which primarily affect the climate of western Canada during winter. Extended drought records inferred from tree rings indicate that drought on the Canadian Prairies has exhibited considerable spatial heterogeneity over the last several centuries. For northern Saskatchewan and northwestern Ontario, intervals of persistently low tree growth during the twentieth century were just as long as or longer than low-growth intervals in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. Longer records from southern Alberta suggest that the most intense dry spell in that area during the last 500 yr occurred during the 1720s. At the eastern side of the prairies, the longest dry event is centered around 1700 and may coincide with low lake stands in Manitoba, Minnesota, and North Dakota.

Field infestations by this pest commonly show a distinct ""edge effect"", with infestation levels highest at the field edge and declining inwards. In this study, we characterized the edge effect of C. cinctus infested wheat fields in Montana at four locations in two separate years. ""Infestation level"" refers to the average proportion of wheat stems infested with C. cinctus in samples collected in a given wheat field. The gradual decrease in C. cinctus infestation towards the centre of wheat fields is referred to as the ""infestation slope"", and it was presented as a proportion of infestation level at field edges. We showed that (i) for most of the fields bordering grassland or fallow wheat, a simple exponential decline curve provided a significant fit to the infestation slope; (ii) the infestation slopes in different fields and in different directions within fields were similar and appeared to be independent of the overall infestation level; and (iii) the relationship between infestation level and the proportion of samples infested followed an asymptotic curve, which indicates a high level of dispersal of ovipositing C. cinctus females. The general perception has been that the edge effect of C. cinctus infestation is a result of ovipositing C. cinctus females being both weak flyers and short-lived, but our results do not fully corroborate this perception. Currently, the only reliable way to detect C. cinctus infestations is to dissect individual stems and look for developing instars. However, this type of sampling is extremely time consuming and labor intensive and therefore impractical for wheat growers. Increasing the understanding of the spatial patterns in C. cinctus infestations is a first step towards development of an optimal sampling plan for this important field pest.

In North America's temperate grassland biome, Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) is a native species used in tree plantings that aggressively invades in the absence of controlling processes. Cedar is a well-studied woody encroacher, but little is known about the degree to which cedar windbreaks, which are advocated for in agroforestry programs, are contributing to woody encroachment, what factors are associated with cedar spread from windbreaks, nor where encroachment from windbreaks is occurring in contemporary social–ecological landscapes. We used remotely sensed imagery to identify the presence and pattern of woody encroachment from windbreaks in the Nebraska Sandhills. We used multimodel inference to compare three classes of models representing three hypotheses about factors that could influence cedar spread: (a) windbreak models based on windbreak structure and design elements; (b) abiotic models focused on local environmental conditions; and (c) landscape models characterizing coupled human-natural features within the broader matrix. Woody encroachment was evident for 23% of sampled windbreaks in the Nebraska Sandhills. Of our candidate models, our inclusive landscape model carried 92% of the model weight. This model indicated that encroachment from windbreaks was more likely near roadways and less likely near farmsteads, other cedar plantings, and waterbodies, highlighting strong social ties to the distribution of woody encroachment from tree plantings across contemporary landscapes. Our model findings indicate where additional investments into cedar control can be prioritized to prevent cedar spread from windbreaks. This approach can serve as a model in other temperate regions to identify where woody encroachment resulting from temperate agroforestry programs is emerging. © 2018 The Authors.

This mechanism may minimize increases in soil carbon (C) sequestration despite higher production. Our knowledge about invasion and tissue quality is based on shoots, but roots contribute 50–90% of biomass in vegetation types such as semiarid grasslands. Here we investigate root decomposition rates and tissue quality in the widespread invasive grass Agropyron cristatum, which doubles root mass but not soil C in the Great Plains of North America. Root length was significantly greater beneath Agropyron than native grassland 7 years after minirhizotron installation. However, CO2 evolution from decomposing roots was twice as much for Agropyron roots as for native grass roots (P &lt; 0.05). CO2 evolution from decomposing native grass roots was not significantly different from controls with no root tissue added, suggesting that Agropyron invasion can convert grassland soil to a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Rapid root decomposition was associated with significantly lower lignin content in Agropyron roots than native grass roots, although root N and lignin:N ratios did not differ. We present the first report of root decomposition rates associated with plant invasion. Increases in root length were accompanied by increased root decomposition rates of low-lignin tissue, such that invasion-driven enhanced productivity did not enhance soil C sequestration. Among-species differences in root tissue quality and decomposition rates could influence soil C dynamics during invasions of systems dominated by belowground production, such as tundra, boreal forests, and semiarid grassland. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Balogianni, V.G.; Farrell, R.E.; MacDougall, A.S.; Wilson, S.D.","","18",2015,"Agropyron cristatum; below ground; invasion ecology; lignin; minirhizotron; nitrogen; tissue quality","","","","","","","","",""

It also represents the distinctive Cephoidea superfamily of sawflies (Symphyta) that appeared early during the hymenopteran radiation, but after three early-branching eusymphytan superfamilies that form the base of the order Hymenoptera. We present a high-quality draft genome assembly of 162 Mb in 1,976 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 622 kb. Automated gene annotation identified 11,210 protein-coding gene models and 1,307 noncoding RNA models. Thirteen percent of the assembly consists of 58,000 transposable elements partitioned equally between Class-I and Class-II elements. Orthology analysis reveals that 86% of Cephus proteins have identifiable orthologs in other insects. Phylogenomic analysis of conserved subsets of these proteins supports the placement of the Cephoidea between the Eusymphyta and the parasitic woodwasp superfamily Orussoidea. Manual annotation and phylogenetic analysis of families of odorant, gustatory, and ionotropic receptors, plus odorant-binding proteins, shows that Cephus has representatives for most conserved and expanded gene lineages in the Apocrita (wasps, ants, and bees). Cephus has also maintained several insect gene lineages that have been lost from the Apocrita, most prominently the carbon dioxide receptor subfamily. Furthermore, Cephus encodes a few small lineage-specific chemoreceptor gene family expansions that might be involved in adaptations to new grasses including wheat.

The purpose of this study was to explore a different kind of trait - floral scent - in Phlox divaricata, a species noted for its strong scent. Specifically, we predicted the diel emission patterns of floral scent might covary with the daily abundance of diurnal moths, identified in a previous study as the most important pollinators in a Konza Prairie population of P. divaricata. Consistent with this prediction, we documented peaks in median floral scent emissions at 1000-1200 and 1930-2130, coinciding with peaks in moth visitation and resulting seed production. Two groups of scent compounds contributed to this pattern; linalool and its associated lilac aldehyde/alcohol compounds (especially lilac aldehyde B) contributed a greater proportion to scent at 1000-1200, while aromatic compounds (including benzaldehyde and benzyl acetate) contributed a greater proportion to scent at 1930-2130 and other afternoon time periods. These volatiles are known floral attractants for several lepidopteran pollinators, including noctuid moths. However, there is an additional peak in pollinator abundance (Hemaris diurnal hawkmoths) and seed set at a time when scent production is relatively low (1400-1600) suggesting additional factors mediate both pollinator behavior and floral volatile emissions. Future studies of P. divaricata should test for the presence of destructive floral enemies that might be attracted by floral volatiles during mid-afternoon periods, as well as the importance of visual floral traits (color, shape) in attracting diurnal moths, an important functional group of pollinators that has received minimal attention in North America. © 2015, University of Notre Dame.

Another common difficulty is geographic separation, which tends to foment classification of distinct species even if the common history is very recent. The complex nature of species delimitation, coupled with our ability to merge important amounts of information from different disciplines, led to the creation of the notion of integrative taxonomy to define species (Dayrat 2005). This approach seeks consensus among distinct disciplines and attempts to use the evolutionary perspective to understand mechanisms of species divergence and resolve disagreements (Pante et al. 2015). The pragmatic definition of species thus remains complex, multidimensional, and provisional, and corresponds to the best understanding of the biology and evolution of the organisms under study. Difficulties and Progress in Lagomorph Systematics Lagomorphs comprise more than 90 species, distributed in 2 families, Ochotonidae and Leporidae. The family Ochotonidae is composed of a single genus, Ochotona, known as pikas. The leporids are composed of 11 genera, 10 known as rabbits and 1 as hares (Lepus). Most rabbit genera (Brachylagus, Bunolagus, Caprolagus, Oryctolagus, Pentalagus, Poelagus, and Romerolagus) are monotypic. Taxonomy and systematics are often considered to be synonymous. However, taxonomy is a branch of biology concerned with identifying, naming, and classifying organisms, whereas systematics includes both taxonomy and the relatedness over time in the form of a tree of life (phylog eny). Thus, systematics aims to classify and name biodiversity components according to evolutionary patterns. One of the major challenges of systematics is species delimitation as the basic unit of the classification of biodiversity. Because evolution is a continuous process and species as taxonomic entities are discrete units, this task remains fairly controversial among specialists. From the initial naturalist perspective, when morphology was generally used as the sole guide for species classification, to the present, when our ability to collect massive amounts of information from natural populations is unprecedented, this debate has resulted in numerous attempts to create simple definitions using objective criteria (see, e.g., Avise 2004 for a summary of species concepts). While for deep levels of divergence different concepts tend to agree in the identification of species, for closely related natural populations that lie in the so- called gray zone of species divergence, different criteria result in distinct classifications (De Queiroz 2007), generating obvious difficulties for taxonomy. In addition, even within species concepts, the continuous makeup of population diversification and the peculiarities of each situation create substantial difficulties inherent to the evolutionary process. For example, extensive sharing of characters among sister species is expected in cases of speciation 3 Systematics of Lagomorphs josé melo- ferreira and paulo c. alves 1709048_int_cc2015.indd 9 15/9/2017 15:59 10   Systematics of Lagomorphs Thus, most lagomorph species are included in only 3 genera: Ochotona (29), Sylvilagus (18), and Lepus (32). While there are some inconsistencies in the phylogenetic relationships at a generic level, namely, among the rabbit group (Matthee et al. 2004), the main systematic concerns are among the species within genera. These controversies are mainly related to evolutionary history (rapid radiation, local adaption, and hybridization) and ecological features (inhabiting a great variety of environments, including the arctic, deserts, grasslands, or tropical and boreal forests), coupled with extensive lack of information on many of the species within Ochotona, Sylvilagus, and Lepus. Rapid Radiations During most of the past 45 million years, lagomorphs were much more common on the planet than today (López- Martínez 2008). The fossil record shows that around 78 genera and more than 200 species inhabited both the Old World and North America, suggesting that lagomorphs underwent numerous explosive radiations during their evolution. This led to complete replacement and diversification of genera and species over very short periods of time. At the generic level, lagomorphs initially spread rapidly in Asia and North America during the Eocene, and later to Europe during Late Eocene–Early Oligocene, and then to Africa in the Late Oligocene– Early Miocene. The most recent diversification occurred during the Pliocene, with a subsequent decline during the Quaternary (López- Martínez 2008). A similar pattern of rapid radiations is seen at the species level. At the end of Miocene, e.g., the formation of the steppe zone in Eurasia allowed the rapid diversification of the genus Ochotona (see, e.g., Erbajeva and Zheng 2005). Likewise, diversification of leporids was explosive (Hibbard 1963), and within the genus Lepus extant. © 2018 Johns Hopkins University Press.","Alves, P.C.; Melo-Ferreira, J.","","",2018,"","","","","","","","","",""

At a local scale, we characterized the geochemical evolution of the 92-ha Cottonwood Lake study area (CWLSA), located in North Dakota, USA. Critical zone processes are the long-term determinant of wetland water and groundwater geochemistry via the interaction of oxygenated groundwater with pyrite in the underlying glacial till. Pyrite oxidation produced a brown, iron oxide-bearing surface layer locally over 13m thick and an estimated minimum of 1.3×1010g sulfate (SO42-) at CWLSA. We show that the majority of this SO42- now resides in solid-phase gypsum (CaSO4 2H2O) and gypsum-saturated groundwater.Results from the CWLSA were scaled up to a 9700km2 area surrounding CWLSA using ~1800 drill logs and literature data on wetland water chemistry for 178 wetlands within this larger area. The oxidized brown zone depth and wetland water compositional trends are very similar to the CWLSA. Additionally, surface water data from 176 southern Canadian pothole wetlands that conform to the same wetland water geochemical trends as those recorded in the CWLSA further corroborate that SO42- accumulation driven by pyrite oxidation is a nearly ubiquitous process in the prairie pothole region and distinguishes PPR wetlands from other wetlands worldwide that have a similar overall hydrology.","Goldhaber, M.B.; LaBaugh, J.W.; Mills, C.T.; Morrison, J.M.; Mushet, D.M.; Stricker, C.A.","","387",2014,"Cottonwood Lake; Kidder County, ND; Prairie pothole region; Stutsman County, ND; Wetland geochemistry; Wetland sulfur geochemistry","","","","","","","","",""

While there has been a recent growth of approaches to spatially model predation risk, these approaches lack an adequate mechanistic framework that can be applied to real landscapes. In this paper we show how predation risk can be decomposed into encounter and attack stages, and modeled spatially using resource selection functions (RSF) and resource selection probability functions (RSPF). We use this approach to compare the effects of landscape attributes on the relative probability of encounter, the conditional probability of death given encounter, and overall wolf and elk resource selection to test whether predation risk is simply equivalent to location of the predator. We then combine the probability of encounter and conditional probability of death into a spatially explicit function of predation risk following Lima and Dill's reformulation of Holling's functional response. We illustrate this approach in a wolf-elk system in and adjacent to Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. In this system we found that the odds of elk being encountered by wolves was 1.3 times higher in pine forest and 4.1 times less in grasslands than other habitats. The relative odds of being killed in pine forests, given an encounter, increased by 1.2. Other habitats, such as grasslands, afforded elk reduced odds (4.1 times less) of being encountered and subsequently killed (1.4 times less) by wolves. Our approach illustrates that predation risk is not necessarily equivalent to just where predators are found. We show that landscape attributes can render prey more or less susceptible to predation and effects of landscape features can differ between the encounter and attack stages of predation. We conclude by suggesting applications of our approach to model predator-prey dynamics using spatial predation risk functions in theoretical and applied settings.

Based on a detailed sedimentological analysis of cores, we describe and interpret 13 sedimentary subfacies grouped in 9 associations which characterize the following lacustrine subenvironments: clastic littoral (freshwater and saline), springs, microbial mats, bench slope, and pelagial (oxic, alternating oxic-anoxic, anoxic and hypersaline, and organic-dominated). Lateral distribution and vertical evolution of subfacies in our model are controlled by climate fluctuations, climate-related limnological parameters (lake level, TDS and brine composition, and redox conditions), and autocyclic processes (progressive infilling of the basin and higher sedimentation rate in the pclagial realm). Microbial and chemical processes govern deposition in this system, and meromixis plays a decisive role in lake dynamics. Phototropic bacterial plate communites at the chemocline dominated as pelagial organic producers during stable meromictic periods, whereas benthic microbial communities developed during mixed water periods. Water stratification during the Holocene was mainly controlled by three parameters: 1) basin morphometry, 2) lake level, and 3) differences in TDS values between mixolimnion and monimolimnion waters. Sedimentary facies analyses is a powerful descriptive and interpretative tool that greatly contributes to deciphering the high resolution paleoenvironmental information archived in lake sequences. Depositional and paleoenvironmental models provide a dynamic framework for integrating paleolimnological data and other proxy paleorecords. Medicine lake serves as a facies model for shallow, perennial hypersaline, meromictic lakes in modern and ancient lacustrine basins. The sediment sequence from Medicine lake cores is consistent with the general paleoclimatic evolution of the northern Great Plains since the retreat of ice sheets. Our study reveals a plethora of rapid fluctuations in the water cycle both during the middle and the late Holocene.

A new method to derive the surface temperature from satellite microwave measurements that improves the frequency of measurements relative to that of infrared data is presented. The daily Special Sensor Microwave Imager 25 km × 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) dataset provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, is processed to derive the surface temperature using the method proposed by Fily et al. A normalization approach based on the 40-yr ECMWF reanalysis (ERA-40; 2.5°) temperature diurnal cycle fitted for each pixel is applied to overcome the time acquisition variation of measurements as well as to interpolate missing data. An adaptive mask for discriminating between ice-free pixels and snow-free pixels is also applied. The resulting database is thus a new consistent hourly series of near-surface air temperatures during the summer (without snow). The mean accuracy is on the order of 2.5-3 K when compared with the synchronous in situ air temperature and different gridded datasets over Canada and Alaska. The trend over the last 10 yr confirms observed climate evolution: an increase in summer surface temperature of +0.09° ± 0.04°C yr-1, at the 90% confidence level, for Canada between 1992 and 2002, whereas a decrease of -0.15° ± 0.05°C yr-1, at the 95% confidence level, is observed for Alaska. Spatial and temporal anomalies show regional impacts of meteorological phenomena such as the El Niño extreme warm summer episode of 1998, the decrease in temperatures in 1992 in Canada following the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991, and the strong drought in the prairies in 2001. The annual sum of positive degree-days (thawing index) has been related to the permafrost distribution. The lower values of the derived thawing index (&lt;1400 degree-days) are related well to the presence of continuous and dense discontinuous permafrost.

This zone lies in the Transition Zone, a biogeographical important area of North America characterized by a remarkable local environmental heterogeneity. However, little is known about the taxonomic composition, and organization of the assemblage of native small mammal, and the influence of local ecological factors, particularly from different vegetation types. Therefore, we were interested in documenting the species composition and structure of the small mammal assemblages of this sierra and provide insights into the nesting level of the community and deviations from a random organization. The study area was a place named ""El Durangueño"" ranch, Durango, México. Three different vegetation types (grassland, and oak-pine and pine-oak forests) were sampled there during every season of 2005 to 2006. During three consecutive nights rodents of each site were captured, recaptured, and taxonomically identified. Results produced 520 individuals (386 captures, 134 recaptures) of 18 small mammal species (14 mice, four squirrels) of different body sizes that represent neartic, neotropical, or shared affinity; endemicity of taxa was found as well as taxa in some extinction risk category. Species richness and eveness were high and the diversity and population levels were moderate, although high density of small mammals highlights oak-pine forest whereas dominance of some species occurs in pine-oak forest perhaps due to disturbance. Spatial pattern of medium-size species was not at random. Assemble of species revealed a non-nested pattern and displayed a log-normal distribution, characterized by four common and widely distributed rodent species (Peromyscus truei, P. maniculatus, Reithrodontomys montanus, and Sigmodon leucotis), and seven of restricted distribution. On the other hand, several species were allocated to different trophic-niche guilds, as revealed by their reported food preferences, that were composed by up to two dominant species by site. In conclusion, the small mammal assemblage of forests of Sierra Madre is distinctive and diverse, is not structured at random and vegetation may be one of the ecological factors that have played an important evolutionary role.","Aragón, E.E.; Cervantes, F.A.; Garza, A.","","82",2009,"Assemble; Conservation; Rodent; Sierra madre occidental; Temperate forest","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents observations of ephemeral channels and valley networks in the high plains of Colorado, USA, with an eye toward painting a picture of the ingredients that must be included in mathematical models of landscape evolution in such environments. Channel incision in the study area is driven by summer thunderstorms, which can with reasonable frequency (3-5 yr) generate boundary shear stresses high enough to penetrate the highly resistant vegetation armor, but only within erosional hot spots where hydraulic forces are amplified by channel constriction and locally steep gradients. Focusing of erosion at these hot spots (which correspond to knickpoints and channel heads) is amplified by the small areal footprint and short ""erosional reach"" of most convective storms. Upstream migration of knickpoints creates a pattern of short, active channel reaches separated by unchanneled or weakly channeled, fully vegetated stable reaches. Based on our observations, we interpret the necessary and sufficient conditions leading to the observed channel forms and dynamics as: (1) a resistant vegetation layer overlying an erodible substrate, which sets up a conditional instability through which erosional perturbations can grow by positive feedback; (2) high flow variability; (3) moderate to high substrate cohesion; and (4) a high volume fraction of fine-grained erodible material. Concave-upward valley long profiles are interpreted as a trade-off between downstream-increasing flood frequency and downstream-decreasing flood effectiveness. The observed process dynamics imply that long-term rates of valley incision should be especially sensitive to climatic oscillations between episodes of drought and warm-season convective rainfall. © 2006 Geological Society of America.","Arnold, L.; Bras, R.L.; Flores, H.; Istanbulluoglu, E.; Sólyom, P.; Tucker, G.E.","","118",2006,"Arroyos; Climate; Erosion; Gullies; Networks; Streams","","","","","","","","",""

This new palaeoecological database and global vegetation reconstruction can be used both for the purposes of validating future palaeoclimate model simulations, as well as a land cover dataset to initialise palaeoclimate modelling experiments. Our Tortonian reconstruction shows significant changes in the distribution of vegetation compared to modern natural vegetation. For example in contrast to the modern scenario in the Northern Hemisphere, boreal forests reached 80°N and temperate forests were present above 60°N. Warm-temperate forests covered much of Europe, coastal North America and South-East Asia. Our reconstruction shows a spread of temperate savanna in central USA, the Middle East and on the Tibetan Plateau. Evidence for arid deserts is sparse, with the exception of the Atacama region (South America). Areas that exhibit arid desert today in the Tortonian were instead covered by shrublands, grasslands, savannas and woodlands. The extent of tropical forests in South America was likely reduced but expanded in the Indian sub-continent and East Africa. This pattern of global vegetation in the Late Miocene suggests a warmer and wetter world, which is supported by the pattern of climate anomalies predicted by our best-fit palaeoclimate-vegetation model experiment. Global mean annual temperature may have been as much as 4.5°C higher than present day with many regions experiencing higher than modern amounts of precipitation over the annual cycle. The pattern of temperature and precipitation change reconstructed palaeobotanically, and predicted within our climate model experiment, infers a global forcing agent on Tortonian climate (e.g. such as elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases) to explain the observed and modelled climate anomalies.

However, neither the climatic driver nor the seasonal character of precipitation during this period is well understood because of the limitations of available proxy indicators. For example, an important challenge is to distinguish among the interacting effects of evaporation, temperature, or precipitation seasonality in existing δ18O records from the region. Here we combine hydrogen isotopes of palmitic acid and oxygen isotopes of carbonate to derive lake-water isotopic values during the Holocene at Steel Lake in north-central Minnesota. In combination, these data enable us to separate variations in evaporation from variations in the isotopic composition of input-waters to lake. Variations in evaporation are used as a proxy for aridity and lake-water input isotopic values are used as a proxy for the isotopic values of meteoric precipitation. Our results suggest that lake-water input isotopic values were more negative during the middle Holocene than at present. To test whether these more negative values are related to temperature or precipitation seasonality, we compare pollen-inferred temperatures and the expected isotopic value of precipitation resulting from these temperatures to the reconstructed precipitation isotopic values. Results suggest that middle Holocene warmth and aridity were associated with increased evaporation rates and decreased summer precipitation. These inferences are consistent with climate simulations that highlight the role of seasonal insolation and sea surface temperatures in driving variations in precipitation seasonality during the Holocene. Results also suggest that changes in Holocene precipitation seasonality may have influenced the expansion of the prairie-forest border in Minnesota as well as regional variations in grassland community composition.

The Hatch Mesa succession (Campanian, lower Kenilworth Member) is a marine mudstone-encased, turbiditic sandstone body, 6 to 20 m thick, that is exposed along a 7-km-long outcrop belt, approximately 15 km east of Green River, Utah, U.S.A. Various interpretations of depositional environment and regional correlation have been proposed over the past 20 years. A sedimentological analysis of the Hatch Mesa succession suggests deposition as a storm-influenced, prodelta turbidite complex on the shallow inner shelf, between fair-weather and storm wave base. This interpretation is corroborated by the high-resolution outcrop correlation and subsequent paleogeographic reconstruction, which indicates deposition 16 to 21 km basinward of the time equivalent lower-shoreface deposits, in about 20 m water depth. A variety of mechanisms are capable of generating instability in the delta front and triggering the turbid flow of sediments into deeper water, including storm events, river flooding, high rates of sedimentation, or earthquakes. This explains the complex mixture of event beds in the Hatch Mesa succession, which are dominated by wave-modified turbidites. A three-component model, consisting of delta-front, subaqueous channel, and prodelta turbidite deposits, is proposed to explain the depositional environment and setting of the Hatch Mesa succession. All three components are observed in the lower Kenilworth Member to upper Aberdeen Member stratigraphic interval. The results of this study indicate that shallow marine facies models should be revised to include marine mudstone-encased, prodelta turbidite complexes, thus adding one more possibility to the diverse suite of interpretations used to explain the generation and preservation of isolated marine sandstone bodies. These results also shed new light on the stratigraphic position and depositional setting of the Mancos Shale-encased, isolated sandstone bodies of the Prairie Canyon Member in eastern Utah and western Colorado.

Overgrazing, reduced fire frequency, and climate change are known drivers of woody plant encroachment into grasslands. In this study, relatively simple algorithms for encroachment factors (i.e., grazing, grassland fires, and seed dispersal by grazers) are proposed and implemented in the ecohydrological Cellular-Automata Tree Grass Shrub Simulator (CATGraSS). CATGraSS is used in a 7.3km2 rectangular domain located in central New Mexico along a zone of grassland to shrubland transition, where shrub encroachment is currently active. CATGraSS is calibrated and used to investigate the relative contributions of grazing, fire frequency, seed dispersal by herbivores and climate change on shrub abundance over a 150-year period of historical shrub encroachment. The impact of future climate change is examined using a model output that realistically represents current vegetation cover as initial condition, in a series of stochastic CATGraSS future climate simulations. Model simulations are found to be highly sensitive to the initial distribution of shrub cover. Encroachment factors more actively lead to shrub propagation within the domain when the model starts with randomly distributed individual shrubs. However, when shrubs are naturally evolved into clusters, the model response to encroachment factors is muted unless the effect of seed dispersal by herbivores is amplified. The relative contribution of different drivers on modeled shrub encroachment varied based on the initial shrub cover condition used in the model. When historical weather data is used, CATGraSS predicted loss of shrub and grass cover during the 1950s drought. While future climate change is found to amplify shrub encroachment (~13% more shrub cover by 2100), grazing remains the dominant factor promoting shrub encroachment. When we modeled future climate change, however, encroachment still occurred at a reduced rate in the absence of grazing along with pre-grazing fire frequency because of lower shrub water stress leading to reduced shrub mortality which increases the probability of shrub establishment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Caracciolo, D.; Collins, S.L.; Istanbulluoglu, E.; Noto, L.V.","","91",2016,"CA model; Climate change; Ecohydrology; Shrub encroachment","","","","","","","","",""

During the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods (206-65 million years ago, Ma) the climate was more uniformly warm and moist than at present and tropical rainforests were widespread. Grasses evolved during the Jurassic period and they expanded greatly as the climate differentiated with reduced rainfall and temperatures. C4-grasses probably arose during the Oligocene period (24-35 Ma). During the Miocene period (23.8-5.3 Ma) grasslands expanded into huge areas (e.g. prairies in the USA, steppe in Eurasia, and pampas and llanos in South America). During the Quaternary period (1.8 Ma till now) some twenty-two different ice ages with periodicities of about 100 000 years occurred. Eighteen-thousand years ago, north-western Europe had a polar climate with tundra vegetation and the Mediterranean region was covered by steppe. During that time Amazonia was so dry that it was covered in extensive areas of savanna and the Sahara expanded rapidly. Only in the last 10 000 years has a closed rainforest covered the Amazonian region again. However, 9000 years ago a brief period of global warming caused excessive rains, which caused the sea and river levels to rise in north-western Europe with tremendous loss of life. The present period of extreme dryness in the Sahara only started some 5000 years ago and then the desert expanded rapidly into the Sahel. Before that the Sahara was covered by steppe. Global warming took place between about ad 900 and about ad 1200 or 1300 just before the Little Ice Age (1550-1700 ad). The article concludes with a description of temperature and vegetation changes that are occurring in Europe at present. It is predicted that C4-grasses, which are already present in southern Europe, will further expand but that, in the short term, land abandonment will have much more deleterious effects than temperature change due to increased wild fires, loss of biodiversity and desertification. © 2007 The Author.","'T Mannetje, L.","","62",2007,"Climate change; Desertification; Geological time; Global warming; Grasslands","","","","","","","","",""

Following the April 2013 Pautre wildfire in the Grand River National Grasslands of South Dakota, we installed exclosures in three locations along the border of the fire. Grazing exclosures were paired across the fire line to create a burned and nonburned exclosure at each location. Four plots were demarcated in each exclosure. Three plots were defoliated via mowing to 6 cm either 2, 4, or 6 mo following fire, with the fourth maintained as a control. Productivity and species composition data were collected in November 2013, June 2014, August 2014, and July 2015. Fire increased productivity 56% during the 2013 growing season following fire.During the 2014 growing season, there was a tendency for burned sites to maintain greater production. June defoliation resulted in the greatest current-year productivity in 2014 regardless of fire treatment, whereas all other treatments resulted in similar productivity. Fire and defoliation effects on productivity were undetectable in 2015. Community composition was not affected by fire in 2013. Melilotus officinalis was increased by spring defoliation in 2014 and by fire in 2015. Litter was initially reduced by fire but was similar to nonburned levels by 2015. Results indicate that positive fire effects on productivity are limited to the first two growing seasons following fire, whereas defoliation effects manifest the second growing season following fire (first growing season after defoliation). With the exception of old dead material, fire and timing of defoliation affected biomass and community composition independently.

Major and trace-element concentrations from altered volcanic ashes document the presence in the study area of predominantly trachyandesitic and rhyolitic volcanogenic products, resulted from intense volcanic arc to within-plate pyroclastic activity. Concentration values of high field strength elements (HFSE) and selected large ion lithophile elements (LILE) (e.g. Nb, Zr, Th, and Y) obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy strongly support the presence of multiple volcanic sources. Integrated paleoenvironmental and geochemical criteria for provenance determination indicate a bimodal occurrence of basic and acid volcanic products interpreted as reflection of source areas characterized by different tectonic setting and magmatic composition.

Methods: Four populations of big bluestem and one population of sand bluestem were planted in common gardens at four sites across a precipitation gradient from western Kansas to southern Illinois. Internal leaf structure and trichome density of A. gerardii were examined by light microscopy to separate genetic and environmentally controlled traits. Leaf thickness, midrib thickness, bulliform cells, interveinal distance, vein size, and trichome density were quantifi ed.

The greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) has been extirpated from much of the area it once inhabited. However, within a large part of this area the species is not considered to be native, warranting no recovery effort or special protection. Demographic analysis based on provenance data from 238 specimens from museum collections in addition to genetic analyses of 100 mtDNA sequences suggest this species was native to the northern prairies, extending from central Minnesota to Alberta, Canada. Provenance data from 1879 to 1935 indicate that T. cupido would have required colonization and establishment of populations on an average 11,905 km2 every year, with an estimated per capita growth rate of 8.9% per year. These rates seem unrealistic given the limited dispersal and high mortality rates reported for this species. A survey of mtDNA sequences from ""original"" and ""expanded"" ranges revealed no differences in levels of sequence diversity within ranges (π=0.018; SE=0.004) but significant levels of genetic differentiation (F ST=0.034; P=0.013), which suggest that these populations have been relatively isolated for significant evolutionary time periods.

Grassland bird response to fire and grazing","In tallgrass prairie, disturbances such as grazing and fire can generate patchiness across the landscape, contributing to a shifting mosaic that presumably enhances biodiversity. Grassland birds evolved within the context of this shifting mosaic, with some species restricted to one or two patch types created under spatially and temporally distinct disturbance regimes. Thus, management-driven reductions in heterogeneity may be partly responsible for declines in numbers of grassland birds. We experimentally altered spatial heterogeneity of vegetation structure within a tallgrass prairie by varying the spatial and temporal extent of fire and by allowing grazing animals to move freely among burned and unburned patches (patch treatment). We contrasted this disturbance regime with traditional agricultural management of the region that promotes homogeneity (traditional treatment). We monitored grassland bird abundance during the breeding seasons of 2001-2003 to determine the influence of altered spatial heterogeneity on the grassland bird community. Focal disturbances of patch burning and grazing that shifted through the landscape over several years resulted in a more heterogeneous pattern of vegetation than uniform application of fire and grazing. Greater spatial heterogeneity in vegetation provided greater variability in the grassland bird community. Some bird species occurred in greatest abundance within focally disturbed patches, while others occurred in relatively undisturbed patches in our patch treatment. Henslow's Sparrow, a declining species, occurred only within the patch treatment. Upland Sandpiper and some other species were more abundant on recently disturbed patches within the same treatment. The patch burn treatment created the entire gradient of vegetation structure required to maintain a suite of grassland bird species that differ in habitat preferences. Our study demonstrated that increasing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of disturbance in grasslands increases variability in vegetation structure that results in greater variability at higher trophic levels. Thus, management that creates a shifting mosaic using spatially and temporally discrete disturbances in grasslands can be a useful tool in conservation. In the case of North American tallgrass prairie, discrete fires that capitalize on preferential grazing behavior of large ungulates promote a shifting mosaic of habitat types that maintain biodiversity and agricultural productivity. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Davis, C.A.; Engle, D.M.; Fuhlendorf, S.D.; Hamilton, R.G.; Harrell, W.C.; Leslie Jr., D.M.","","16",2006,"Conservation biology; Disturbance; Diversity; Grassland birds; Henslow's Sparrow; Heterogeneity; Oklahoma; Rangelands; Tallgrass Prairie Preserve; Upland Sandpiper","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, Brontops and Subhyracodon exhibit lower (- 11.2‰) and higher (- 8.7‰) values, respectively. Early Oligocene values for Mesohippus and Merycoidodon remain indistinguishable from each other and lower than the value of Leptomeryx, Poebrotherium, and Subhyracodon (∼ - 8.5‰). These results likely indicate niche separation in terms of habitat preference between the investigated sympatric taxa. More specifically, assuming a δ13C value of atmospheric CO2 of - 5.5‰, our data suggest a preference of Brontops for mesic forested areas, of Mesohippus and Merycoidodon for woodlands, and of Subhyracodon and Poebrotherium for more open habitats (e.g., grasslands). The higher Oligocene versus Eocene average δ13C exhibited by Leptomeryx possibly reflects a preference of the new Oligocene species L. evansi for more open and/or xeric habitats relative to the Eocene species L. speciosus. Late Eocene and early Oligocene average δ18O of Mesohippus, Merycoidodon, Leptomeryx, and Subhyracodon are similar (∼ 25‰, V-SMOW), possibly indicating comparable water dependency for these taxa. In contrast, the higher δ18O of Poebrotherium (26.6‰) suggests lower water dependency whereas the lower δ18O of Brontops (23.0‰) may result from a high water dependency or, more likely, from its preference for humid habitats. Because hind-gut fermentation in perissodactyls requires high water intake, whereas fore-gut fermentation does not, our results might indicate the presence of fore-gut fermentation in early Oligocene camelids but its absence or incomplete development in late Eocene-early Oligocene oreodonts and leptomerycids. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In the patchy environment of arid lands the characteristics of both processes may vary between habitats causing differences in the recruitment of new genets. To test this hypothesis we used populations of the desert cactus Opuntia rastrera which has different recruitment rates in the two adjacent habitats where it grows. In Opuntia-dominated scrublands (nopaleras, density ca. 4,000 plants/ha) 1 seedling out of 7,000,000 seeds establish, whereas in grasslands (density ca. 100 plants/ha) this ratio is 1:20,000. From 1996 until 1998 the seed rain, seed removal by granivores and seed abundance in the soil were monitored in both habitats. Results showed striking differences in the dynamics of the seed bank of both habitats. Seed rain was 8.5 times bigger in nopaleras than in grasslands. In nopaleras most seeds were removed by rodents while the quantities of seeds removed by rodents, birds and ants in grasslands were similar. One year after dispersal (the time necessary to break seed dormancy) only 6% of original nopalera seeds and 12% of grassland seeds remained. After germination trials only 1% (ca. 15,000 seeds/ha) and 2% (ca. 2,500 seeds/ha) respectively were viable. These differences in the effective seed bank (6 times bigger in nopaleras) can not explain the differences in genet recruitment (which is several orders of magnitude bigger in grasslands). Apparently the between habitat difference in nurse plant availability and in rodent density (which inflict a strong hervibory upon seedlings) can explain the differences in genet recruitment. It is speculated that this between habitat difference in genet recruitment suggests that the species evolved in less extreme environments (e.g. grasslands) than desert scrublands which, in turn, are colonised due to the singular ability of O. rastrera for vegetative propagation.","Montaña, C.; Montiel, S.","","166",2003,"Cactus recruitment; Dormancy; Grassland; Nopalera; Seed-predation; Seed-rain","","","","","","","","",""

I examined the hypothesis that burning was more frequent during wet years using charcoal to reconstruct fire histories near Coldwater Lake in southcentral ND, and Rice Lake in northcentral ND and published records of ostracod Mg/Ca ratios as a proxy for climate at these same two sites. Over the past 10000 years, charcoal influx rates for Coldwater (0.04-5.68 mm2 cm-2 year-1) greatly exceeded influx rates for Rice (&lt;0.01-1.91 mm2 cm-2 year-1). Both sites showed strong, significant periodicities of ∼1500-1800, ∼800-900 and ∼130-140 years but charcoal maxima and minima were only similar at ∼4200 cal years BP. Charcoal influx during the past 2000 years also revealed strong periodicities of between 310-400 and 140 years at both sites. Comparison of smoothed charcoal influxes and ostracod Mg/Ca ratios suggests that both proxies are responding to changes in climate. When smoothed with a 320-400-year window, increases in charcoal influx typically preceded rises in ostracod Mg/Ca ratio by ∼50-100 years, and further smoothing (140-year window) of the residuals suggested a variable relationship between Mg/Ca ratios and charcoal influx. These results do not clearly support or reject the fuel limitation hypothesis, and this lack of clear support may result from (a) climate-driven shifts in the mix of C3 and C4 grasses resulting in maximum productivity at intermediate moisture levels, (b) possibly different responses of charcoal and Mg/Ca ratios to summer vs. winter precipitation, or (c) ground-water driven lags in the response of Mg/Ca ratios to shifts in climate. Comparison of the results from this study with other studies suggests that links between fire and fuels at finer time scales (0-100 years) may be broadly constrained by longer term (∼500-2000 years) patterns of climate in the northern Great Plains. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Location The West Carrizo Canyon drains the Chaquaqua Plateau, a plateau that projects into the western extent of the southern Great Plains grasslands in south-eastern Colorado, USA. Elevations of the study sites are 1448 to 1525 m a.s.l. Today the plateau is mostly Juniperus scopulorum-P. edulis woodland. Methods Plant macrofossils and pollen assemblages were analysed from 11 14C-dated packrat middens. Ages ranged from 5990 yr bp (6839 cal. yr bp) to 280 yr bp (485 cal. yr bp). Results The results presented here provide information on the establishment and expansion of Juniperus-P. edulis woodland at its eastern limits. The analysis of both plant macrofossils and pollen from the 11 middens documents changes in plant communities over the last 7000 years, and the establishment of P. edulis at its easternmost limit. Though very minor amounts of P. edulis pollen occur as early as the middle Holocene, plant macrofossils were only recovered in middens dating after c. 480 cal. yr bp. Main conclusions Originally, midden research suggested a late glacial refuge to the north-east of the Carrizo Canyon site, and a middle Holocene expansion of P. edulis. Results reported here are consistent with a late Holocene expansion, here at its eastern limits, but noted elsewhere at its northern and north-eastern limits. In general, this late Holocene expansion is consistent with pollen data from sediments in Colorado and New Mexico, and suggests that P. edulis is still expanding its range at its present extremes. This has implications for further extension of its range due to changing climatic conditions in the future. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Anderson, R.S.; Feiler, E.","","36",2009,"Biogeography; Climate change; Colorado; Great Plains; Holocene vegetation change; Packrat middens; Pinus edulis; Plant macrofossils; Pollen; Range expansion","","","","","","","","",""

However, differential species preservation and collection (including body-size bias) in both modern and fossil death assemblages may still skew the representation of other important ecological characteristics. Here, we move beyond live-dead taxonomic fidelity and focus on the recovery of functional ecology (how species interact with their ecosystem) at the community level for a diverse non-volant mammal community (87 species; Amboseli, Kenya). We use published literature to characterize species, using four functional traits and their associated categorical attributes (i) dietary mode (11 attributes; e.g., browser, grazer), (ii) preferred feeding habitat (16 attributes; e.g., grassland, woodland), (iii) preferred sheltering habitat (17 attributes; e.g., grassland, underground cavity), and (iv) activity time (7 attributes; e.g., diurnal, nocturnal, nocturnally dominated crepuscular). For each functional ecological trait we compare the death assemblage's recovered richness and abundance structure of constituent functional attributes with those of the source community, using Jaccard similarity, Spearman's rho, and the Probability of Interspecific Encounter (evenness). We use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate whether these empirical comparisons are significantly different from expectations calculated from randomized sampling of species from the source community. Results indicate that although the Amboseli death assemblage is significantly overrepresented by large-bodied species relative to the Amboseli source community, it captures many functional dimensions of the ecosystem within expectations of a randomized collection of species. Additional resampling simulations and logistic regressions further illustrate that the size bias inherent to the Amboseli death assemblage is not a major driver of deviations between the functional ecological properties of the death assemblage and its source community. Finally, the Amboseli death assemblage also enhances our understanding of the mammal community by adding nine species and two functional attributes previously unknown from the ecosystem. © The Paleontological Society.

Sage-grouse are a candidate for endangered species listing due to habitat and population fragmentation coupled with inadequate regulation to control development in critical areas. Conservation planning would benefit from accurate maps delineating required habitats and movement corridors. However, developing a species distribution model that incorporates the diversity of habitats used by sage-grouse across their widespread distribution has statistical and logistical challenges. We first identified the ecological minimums limiting sage-grouse, mapped similarity to the multivariate set of minimums, and delineated connectivity across a 920,000 km2 region. We partitioned a Mahalanobis D2 model of habitat use into k separate additive components each representing independent combinations of species-habitat relationships to identify the ecological minimums required by sage-grouse. We constructed the model from abiotic, land cover, and anthropogenic variables measured at leks (breeding) and surrounding areas within 5 km. We evaluated model partitions using a random subset of leks and historic locations and selected D2 (k = 10) for mapping a habitat similarity index (HSI). Finally, we delineated connectivity by converting the mapped HSI to a resistance surface. Sage-grouse required sagebrush-dominated landscapes containing minimal levels of human land use. Sage-grouse used relatively arid regions characterized by shallow slopes, even terrain, and low amounts of forest, grassland, and agriculture in the surrounding landscape. Most populations were interconnected although several outlying populations were isolated because of distance or lack of habitat corridors for exchange. Land management agencies currently are revising land-use plans and designating critical habitat to conserve sage-grouse and avoid endangered species listing. Our results identifying attributes important for delineating habitats or modeling connectivity will facilitate conservation and management of landscapes important for supporting current and future sage-grouse populations. © 2013 The Authors.

Extant grazing ungulates (hoofed mammals) have hypsodont teeth (a derived condition), and so extinct hypsodont forms have usually been presumed to have been grazers. Thus, hypsodonty among ungulates has, over the past 150 years, formed the basis of widespread palaeoecological interpretations, and has figured prominently in the evolutionary study of the spread of grasslands in the mid Cenozoic. However, perceived inconsistencies between levels of hypsodonty and dental wear patterns in both extant and extinct ungulates have caused some workers to reject hypsodonty as a useful predictive tool in palaeobiology, a view that we consider both misguided and premature. Despite the acknowledged association between grazing and hypsodonty, the quantitative relationship of hypsodonty to the known ecology of living ungulate species, critical in making interpretations of the fossil record, was little studied until the past two decades. Also, much of the literature on ungulate ecology relevant to understanding hypsodonty has yet to be fully incorporated into the perspectives of palaeontologists. Here we review the history and current state of our knowledge of the relationship between hypsodonty and ungulate ecology, and reassert the value of hypsodonty for our understanding of ungulate feeding behaviour. We also show how soil consumption, rather than the consumption of grass plants per se, may be the missing piece of the puzzle in understanding the observed correlation between diets, habitats, and hypsodonty in ungulates. Additionally, we show how hypsodonty may impact life-history strategies, and resolve some controversies regarding the relevance of hypsodonty to the prediction of the diets of extinct species. This in turn strengthens the utility of hypsodonty in the determination of past environmental conditions, and we provide a revised view of a traditional example of evolutionary trends in palaeobiology, that of the evolution of hypsodonty in horses and its correlation with the Miocene spread of grasslands in North America. © 2011 The Authors.

Conceptual state-and-transition models (STMs) describe both types of ecosystem dynamics by including state transitions (plant community changes difficult-to-reverse without substantial input or effort) and phase shifts (easily reversible community changes) as consequences of management practices and environmental variability. Grazing management is purported to be the primary driver of state transitions in current STMs for North American grasslands, but there is limited empirical evidence from these grasslands showing that grazing can cause difficult-to-reverse transitions between alternate stable states. In a northern mixed-grass prairie in Wyoming, USA, we examined plant community responses to (i) long-term (33-year) grazing intensity treatments (none, light, moderate and heavy stocking rates) and (ii) 8 years of light or no grazing in pastures that were grazed heavily for the previous 25 years. Long-term grazing treatments were associated with distinct, but not stable, plant communities. From year 22 to 33, heavier stocking rates decreased cover of dominant C3 grasses and increased cover of the dominant C4 grass Bouteloua gracilis. Reversing stocking rates from heavy to light or no grazing resulted in reversal of changes induced by prior heavy stocking for dominant C3 grasses, but not for B. gracilis. For both groups, rates of change following grazing treatment reversals were consistent with rates of change during the initial years of the experiment (1982–1990). Synthesis and applications. In a semi-arid rangeland with a long evolutionary history of grazing, different long-term grazing intensity treatments caused slow, continuous and directional changes with important management implications, but did not appear to induce alternative stable states. For this and similar ecosystems, quantifying the time-scales and compositional gradients associated with key phase shifts may be more important than identifying thresholds between alternative stable states.

In the section of Axamilpa river four pedostratigraphic units were recognized. The lower Gleyic and Vertic pedological Units are at the end of marine isotopic stage (MIS) 3 while the upper Humic and (most probably) Calcic Units correspond to MIS 2 according to the radiocarbon dates of humus. The micromorphological analysis indicates an incipient development and syn-sedimentary character of paleopedogenesis in the periodically water-saturated environment (indicated by redoximorphic features, hydrogenic carbonates and low values of magnetic susceptibility in most strata). The δ13C values of the paleosol humus range from -22.6 to -24.7, indicating a C3 vegetation, whereas in the modern soil it is higher (-15.2) pointing to an abundance of the C4 and CAM plants. The δ13C signature of the vegetation inferred from the teeth enamel of the fossil fauna appeared to be less negative than that of humus from corresponding paleosols. The alimentary preferences of the paleofauna which fed on grasses with high proportion of C4 plants explain this difference. The phytolith analysis shows dominance in conifer forms, followed by C4 and C3 grasses. The content of conifer phytoliths is progressively reduced towards the top of the sequence. We interpret the Late Pleistocene landscape of this area as a heterogeneous forest-grassland landscape with the forest shrinking through time and the grass areas increasing. Swampy floodplain meadows (inferred from paleopedological results) could provide a habitat for grassy vegetation. Both isotope and phytolith records demonstrate a contrasting difference between Pleistocene and recent vegetation dominated by xerophytic shrubs and succulents.

Fossil pollen from these basins provides information on vegetation and climate during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. The pollen profile at Raymond Basin contains an expanded Sangamonian section and an early Wisconsinan section, but both are missing the late Wisconsinan. The ages for the following pollen zones are estimated by correlation with the deep-sea δ18O record. In the late Illinoian, Picea-Pinus pollen zone 1, dating from about 150-130 ka, represents an apparently closed boreal coniferous forest indicating a cold late-glacial climate. The Sangamonian includes three major pollen zones ranging from about 130-75 ka. The early Sangamonian is represented by Quercus-Ulmus-Carya-Fagus dominance in zone 2, indicating vegetation comparable to the modern deciduous forest and climate that was warm and moist. The middle Sangamonian in zone 3, which is characterized by Ambrosia-Poaceae-Cupressaceae-Quercus pollen, suggests a savanna vegetation and a warm, dry climate. The late Sangamonian is subdivided into a Quercus-Ulmus-Carya subzone (4a) that indicates a mesic forest and greater precipitation; a Quercus-Ambrosia subzone (4b) that suggests drier climate and savanna conditions; and a Quercus-Liquidambar-Carya subzone (4c), containing the 'southeastern forest' element, Liquidambar, suggesting the peak in warmth and moisture. The early Wisconsinan is represented by a transitional Picea-Chenopodiineae zone (5). This unusual assemblage suggests a cool prairie-like vegetation, perhaps with scattered Picea trees at the end of that depositional interval. The Middle Wisconsinan is marked by the return of high percentages of Picea and Pinus pollen in zone 6. The latest pollen zone (7) is dominated by Chenopodiineae pollen and is absent at Raymond Basin. It is most likely Holocene in age, and probably represents prairie conditions and warm, dry climate. Apparent surface-temperature and apparent effective-moisture curves were derived from the first detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) axis of the pollen data.

Phylogenetic diversity (PD) represents a potentially valuable measure of restoration success because it can correlate with functional trait diversity that drives ecosystem function. However, PD patterns in restored communities are rarely assessed. We surveyed plant communities in restored tallgrass prairies 2–19 years old and calculated two PD measures, SESMNTD and SESMPD, of the communities and seed mixture applied to sites. We also identified high-threat exotic species present in each site to determine whether PD of the seed mixture applied was related to resistance against invasion. We show that PD in North American tallgrass prairie restorations, as measured by both SESMNTD and SESMPD, is maintained over time even as richness declines. Neither the resulting community PD nor invasion by high-threat exotic species was affected by PD of the seed mixture used in site restoration. Thus, simply maximizing PD of seed mixtures without considering the particular component species is unlikely to help achieve restoration goals. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that species losses over time are not biased towards species with or without close relatives in the community. If phylogenetic diversity (PD) reflects functional trait diversity in communities, then local declines in species richness may not necessarily mean the loss of ecosystem function in restoration projects. However, PD of restored communities may be limited by low establishment rates for most species. Conservation practitioners should consider PD with careful planning to maintain overall community diversity and potentially maximize ecosystem function and services in restorations.

The cubic trend is calculated and used to represent the trend related to advances in agricultural technology over this time period. The correlations between Canadian wheat yields at regional scales and the tropical El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability are not robust at any stage of the evolution of ENSO. Based on the power spectrum and cross-spectrum analysis, the most prominent yield variance is found in the Canadian Prairies, with a significant power peak of 4.5 years but does not co-vary significantly with interannual ENSO variability. ENSO weakly affects temperature and precipitation anomalies in the Canadian Prairie Region in summer—two important agroclimatic conditions for crop growth—and hence insignificantly impacts wheat yields. This indicates that there would be little benefit to including tropical ENSO indices in the operational wheat yield forecasting system. For Canadian wheat yield forecasting, attention should be paid to the preceding winter and spring SST anomalies in the northern extratropics. The SST anomalies associated with yields in the Canadian Prairie region and Central Region are generally stronger than those associated with yields in the Canadian Pacific Coast Region and eastern Maritime Region. In association with the Prairie Region and Central Region yields, SST shows pronounced anomalies in the mid-high latitudes of the North Pacific from winter to summer. The non-linearity of the SST anomalies associated with the Canadian yields is also clearly evident. Stronger (weaker) SST anomalies in the extratropical North Pacific correspond to low wheat yields in the Prairie (Central) Region, while weaker (stronger) SST anomalies correspond to high yields in the Prairie (Central) Region. © 2017 The Author(s).

Considering both in situ and ex situ populations provides an integrated approach to the preservation of a species' evolutionary potential. The joint use of molecular and environmental analyses allows conservation schemes to be implemented when reintroducing captive populations, and wild populations to be prioritized for conservation purposes. We used genetic data and environmental analyses to select candidate areas for the reintroduction of a captive population of the Mexican prairie dog, Cynomys mexicanus, and prioritize wild populations for the conservation of this endangered endemic species. We estimated the levels of genetic diversity and differentiation of the captive population and compared them with those of six wild populations. We used species distribution modeling (SDM) to perform forecasts under future climate change scenarios and identify areas with suitable environmental conditions for the populations to persist in the medium to long term. The captive population showed high levels of genetic diversity (Hd = 0.692, HE = 0.52), but was genetically differentiated from the wild populations. The genetic structure of wild populations should therefore be considered when reintroducing captive Mexican prairie dogs. In the wild populations, we found a correlation between colony area and nuclear genetic diversity, suggesting that genetic drift and/or inbreeding have been stronger in smaller colonies. The occupied climate space was well differentiated among wild colonies. The impact of agriculture and roads was stronger in the northeastern area of the species range, where SDM forecasts suggest that environmental conditions may remain suitable in the future.

Results show that the sequence contains four unconformity-bounded sub-sequences and should be, therefore, subdivided. They are informally named here, from oldest to youngest, as A1, A2, A3 and A4. Sequence A1 is laterally restricted and consists of the Bigbear and Fault River formations of the Hornby Bay Group on Coppermine Homocline, seismic Sequence A1 in the subsurface, and is potentially equivalent to the very thick Wernecke Supergroup of the Cordillera. Sequence A2 on Coppermine Homocline consists of the clastic Lady Nye Formation, carbonates of the East River Formation, and the syntectonic clastics of the Kaertok and LeRoux formations of the Hornby Bay Group. Sequence A2 in the subsurface consists of the Basinal, Platformal, and Syntectonic seismic units and does not correlate with strata of the Cordillera. A2 strata in the subsurface and on the homocline were deformed by the intracratonic style Forward Orogeny (ca. 1.66Ga), which is likely an expression of the Racklan Orogeny, described from the Cordillera.

Methods: Potential patterns of Indian burning were evaluated based upon historical documents, ethnographic accounts, archaeological records and consideration of contemporary land management tactics. Patterns of vegetation distribution in this region were evaluated relative to environmental factors and the resilience of the dominant shrub vegetation to different fire frequencies. Results: Lightning fire frequency in this region is one of the lowest in North America and the density of pre-Columbian populations was one of the highest. Shrublands dominate the landscape throughout most of the region. These woody communities have weak resilience to high fire frequency and are readily displaced by annual grasses and forbs under high fire frequency. Intact shrublands provided limited resources for native Americans and thus there was ample motivation for using fire to degrade this vegetation to an open mosaic of shrubland/grassland, not unlike the agropastoral modification of ecologically related shrublands by Holocene peoples in the Mediterranean Basin. Alien-dominated grasslands currently cover approximately one-quarter of the landscape and less than 1% of these grasslands have a significant native grass presence. Ecological studies in the Californian coastal ranges have failed to uncover any clear soil or climate factors explaining grassland and shrubland distribution patterns. Main conclusions: Coastal ranges of California were regions of high Indian density and low frequency of lightning fires. The natural vegetation dominants on this landscape are shrubland vegetation that often form dense impenetrable stands with limited resources for Native Americans. Natural fire frequencies are not high enough to maintain these landscapes in habitable mixtures of shrublands and grasslands but such landscape mosaics are readily produced with additional human subsidy of ignitions. It is hypothesized that a substantial fraction of the landscape was type converted from shrubland to grassland and much of the landscape that underwent such type conversion has either been maintained by Euro-American land management practices or resisted recolonization of native shrublands. It appears that these patterns are disturbance dependent and result from anthropogenic alteration of landscapes initiated by Native Americans and sustained and expanded upon by Euro-American settlers.","Keeley, J.E.","","29",2002,"Burning; Chaparral; Coastal sage scrub; Fire; Indians; Landscape history; Lightning; Native Americans; Type conversion","","","","","","","","",""

How does grazing affect succession where undisturbed communities have a long evolutionary history of grazing by native herbivores and are tolerant to livestock grazing? Location: Shortgrass steppe, North American Great Plains, Colorado (40°49'N, 104°46'W), USA. Methods: Ungrazed and grazed early-seral (4-6 yr) and mid-seral (18-20 yr) seeded fields (Conservation Reserve Program) and traditionally grazed native steppe were compared for effects on plant composition in relation to changes expected from regional succession models. Results: Recovery towards undisturbed native shortgrass steppe for early- and mid-seral communities, respectively, was 19% and 36% for total vegetation cover, 5% and 21% for planted native species, 10% and 88% for non-planted native perennial grasses, only 0.2% and 13% for short grasses, and overall dissimilarity in community species compositions was 97% and 68%. In general, grazing effects were neutral or most often not significant in all years and/or were small in overall community magnitude. The early-seral community displayed more changes indicative of a slowing of succession with grazing (total vegetative and grass basal cover) rather than reducing invasive species (species targeted by timing of grazing), although drought had limited the establishment of grazing-tolerant short grasses. The mid-seral community showed more changes consistent with advancing successional recovery with grazing (overall community dissimilarity, forbs, planted native perennial grasses, tall grasses and target species). However, non-planted native perennial grasses responded negatively to grazing in the mid-seral community and positively in native shortgrass steppe where outside seed would originate. Conclusions: Grazing effects on particular functional groups and species were not the same across seral stages, were mixed in terms of speeding or slowing succession, and were generally not large at the community level. Evolutionary history of grazing may serve as a general guide but decisions on whether to graze successional grasslands may best be made after assessing whether tolerant perennial short grass species are significant components. Monitoring may then be necessary to determine species responses in particular community matrixes and effects on subsequent immigration of non-seeded native perennial species. © 2013 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Milchunas, D.G.; Vandever, M.W.","","25",2014,"Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); Grassland recovery after cultivation; Herbivory; Invasive (weed) suppression; Livestock; Opportunistic grazing; Restoration; Revegetation; Secondary succession","","","","","","","","",""

This record indicates that differential isostatic rebound and changing climate have interacted with varying drainage basin size and hydrologic budget to create significant variations in lake level and limnological conditions. During the initial depositional period in the basin, the Lake Agassiz phase (∼12-9 ka), δ18O of ostracodes ranged from -16‰ to -5‰ (PDB), implying the lake was variously dominated by cold, dilute glacial meltwater and warm to cold, slightly saline water. Candona subtriangulata, which prefers cold, dilute water, dominates the most negative δ18O intervals, when the basin was part of proglacial Lake Agassiz. At times during this early phase, the δ18O of the lake abruptly shifted to higher values; euryhaline taxa such as C. rawsoni or Limnocythere ceriotuberosa, and halobiont taxa such as L. staplini or L. sappaensis are dominant in these intervals. This positive covariance of isotope and ostracode records implies that the lake level episodically fell, isolating the Lake Manitoba basin from the main glacial lake. δ18O values from inorganic endogenic Mg-calcite in the post-Agassiz phase of Lake Manitoba trend from -4‰ at 8 ka to -11‰ at 4.5 ka. We interpret that this trend indicates a gradually increasing influence of isotopically low (-20‰ SMOW) Paleozoic groundwater inflow, although periods of increased evaporation during this time may account for zones of less negative isotopic values. The δ18O of this inorganic calcite abruptly shifts to higher values (-6‰) after ∼4.5 ka due to the combined effects of increased evaporative enrichment in a closed basin lake and the increased contribution of isotopically high surface water inflow on the hydrologic budget. After ∼2 ka, the δ18O of the Mg-calcite fluctuates between -13‰ and -7‰, implying short-term variability in the lake's hydrologic budget, with values indicating the lake varied from outflow-dominated to evaporation-dominated. The δ13C values of Mg-calcite remain nearly constant from 8 to 4.5 ka and then trend to higher values upward in the section. This pattern suggests primary productivity in the lake was initially constant but gradually increased after 4.5 ka. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Forester, R.M.; Last, W.M.; Teller, J.T.","","12",1994,"Great Plains; Holocene; magnesian calcite; paleolimnology; stable isotopes; western Canada","","","","","","","","",""

Its chronology is determined by 19 OSL ages. The sand sheet formed primarily during three phases of eolian deflation and deposition, each phase with a separate sand source and under different climatic and environmental circumstances. The first phase of eolian sedimentation occurred 45 to 15ka with the deposition of unit 1. The sand source for the first phase was beach-related features along the eastern shoreline of pluvial Lake Palomas in Mexico. The glacial-age climate was cool, wet, and windy because of the southern path of the jet stream at that time. After 15ka, with the onset of warmer conditions of the Bølling-Allerød, the shutting down of the Palomas sand source, and wet conditions of the Younger Dryas, the sand sheet stabilized with weak soil development in unit 1. By 11ka, the climate shifted to Holocene drying conditions and the second phase of sand accumulation began, forming unit 2; the sand source was the local deflation of the previously deposited unit 1 sand. The sand sheet stabilized again by 1.9ka with slightly wetter late Holocene climate; a weak soil formed in unit 2 sand. About A.D. 1500 and extending to about A.D. 1850 or later, an A horizon formed on the sand sheet, probably in response to a desert grassland vegetation during the period of wet climate of the Little Ice Age. In an anthropogenic third phase of eolian activity, after A.D. 1850, the vegetation was likely disturbed by overgrazing; and the unit 2 and A horizon (unit 3) sands were deflated, resulting in the deposition of a thin layer of massive eolian sand (unit 4) across the sand sheet. By about A.D. 1900 mesquite shrubs had increased in abundance; and deflated sand, largely from unit 2, began to accumulate around the shrubs, forming coppice dunes (unit 5). Mesquite coppice dunes continued to increase in number and volume during the twentieth century and at present dominate most of the sand sheet.

Pioneering work has focused on the CZ in areas with residual soils and steady-state or erosional topography. CZ evolution in these areas is conceptualized as progressive weathering of local bedrock (e.g., in the flow-through reactor model). However, this model is not applicable to areas in which weathering profiles form in transported materials including the formerly glaciated portion of the Central Lowland of North America. We present a new conceptual model of CZ evolution in landscapes impacted by continental glaciation based on investigations at three study sites in the Intensively Managed Landscapes Critical Zone Observatory (IML-CZO) The IML-CZO is devoted to the study of CZ processes in a region characterized by thick surficial deposits resulting from multiple continental glaciations, with bedrock at depths of up to 150m. Here the physical (glacial ice, loess, developing soil profiles) and biological (microbes, tundra, forest, prairie) components of the CZ vary significantly in time. Moreover, the spatial relationships between mineral components of the CZ record a history of glacial-interglacial cycles and landscape evolution. We present cross-sections from IML-CZO sites to provide specific examples of how environmental change is recorded by the structure of the mineral components of the CZ. We build on these examples to create an idealized model of CZ evolution through a glacial cycle that represents the IML-CZO sites and other areas of low relief that have experienced continental glaciation. In addition, we identify two main characteristics of CZ structure which should be included in a conceptual model of CZ development in the IML-CZOand similar settings: (1) mineral components have diverse origins and transport trajectories including alteration in past CZs, and, (2) variability in climate, ecosystems, and hydrology during glacial-interglacial cycles profoundly influence the CZ composition, creating a legacy retained in its structure. This legacy is important because the current physical CZ structure influences the occurrence and rates of CZ processes, as well as future CZ responses to land use and climate change. © 2018 Anders, Bettis, Grimley, Stumpf and Kumar.","Anders, A.M.; Bettis, E.A., III; Grimley, D.A.; Kumar, P.; Stumpf, A.J.","","6",2018,"Critical zone; Depositional environment; IML-CZO; Soils formed in glacial sediments; US Interior Lowlands","","","","","","","","",""

However, the ecological response of many other ungulates to this expansion is poorly documented. We use stable carbon isotopes in mammalian tooth enamel to test whether other ungulates adapted by incorporating C4 vegetation in their diets. The openness of habitats before the expansion of C4 grasslands is uncertain, with plant phytolith studies suggesting a patchy environment with open-habitat grasses and forest, and pollen and macrofloral studies suggesting more forested habitats. To address this problem we use a model that predicts carbon isotope values for tooth enamel for a variety of environments, based on values in modern plants. Carbon and oxygen isotopes were analyzed in medium to large herbivores from three late Miocene and three Pliocene local faunas comprising a total of 13 and 7 genera, respectively, and 59 and 42 individuals. Results indicate that before the expansion of C4 grasslands, taxa with high-crowned teeth were consuming predominantly C3 vegetation. In contrast, by the late Pliocene most taxa studied were consuming a component of C4 vegetation and only the peccary Platygonus sp. had a pure C3 diet. C4 consumption increased in the late Pliocene (~3.0Ma) Big Springs local fauna probably in response to increased C4 biomass. Most landscapes in the late Miocene of Nebraska were open, such as woodland-savanna or C3 grassland, although low carbon values from the Pratt Slide local fauna suggest a denser, presumably forested area. This general pattern suggests an expansion of open-habitats no later than 12Ma (early Clarendonian). Through the Miocene-Pliocene transition there was an overall shift to lower δ18O enamel values, which parallels the long-term decrease in global mean annual temperature inferred from the marine record. Our results indicate that major changes in the diets of medium and large herbivores broadly corresponded with increased C4 biomass and cooling climate from the latest Miocene to the late Pliocene. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Boardman, G.S.; Kita, Z.A.; Secord, R.","","399",2014,"Climate; Great Plains; Mammals; Neogene; Paleoecology; Stable isotopes","","","","","","","","",""

The B subhorizons stratigraphically and morphologically resemble the ""reddish pedocomplex"" described elsewhere in Kansas and Illinois that dates between about 69 and 35 ka. The upper LL yields a TL age of about 136 and 130 + 30 ka. Thus, PL, the GCF, and LL were probably deposited mainly during the late Wisconsinan, middle Wisconsinan, and Illinoian (∼ Oxygen Isotope Stages (OIS) 2, 3, and 6, or about 12 to 24, 24 to 60, and 130 to 188 ka, respectively). Soils 1, 2, and 3, then formed mainly during OIS stages 1, 3, and 5, respectively, or about 12 to 12, 60 to 60, and 73 to 130 ka. In comparison with other dated stratigraphic sections in the Great Plains, soils/paleosols have relatively simple, cumulic horizon sequences, as is typical at sites distal from principle loess source regions. Nonetheless, they record a complex pedosedimentary history that reflects climatically-driven variations in rates of sedimentation and pedogenesis. Soil 1 is an Udic Argiustoll with 21-cm A (mollic)/69-cm Bt (argillic)/60-cm Bk horizons, that formed under modern-type grassland and climate. Soil 3, the Sangamon paleosol, includes a 3-m thick, highly rubified and clay-rich argillic horizon that, based on its morphological properties, probably formed under a relatively warm, moist, equable climate and deciduous-type forest. Soil 2 coincides with the GCF, and as such is a pedolithostratigraphic unit that includes a 1.3-m mollic horizon and to 1.6-m oxidized 3Btb and 3BCb horizons. Whereas the oxidized B horizons apparently represent relatively warm, moist climatic conditions between about 65 to 35 ka, the upper cumulic (mollic) A horizons of the GCF probably formed under progressively cooling climate and grassland between about 35.7 and 26.9 (calibrated radiocarbon) ka.

A 46-cm core was extracted from a shallow pond draining the watershed of Chimney Branch, underlain by serpentinite. Core chronostratigraphy was established by identifying two sharp spikes in Cr concentrations correlated with historic Cr mining activity peaks and an abrupt increase in pine needle abundance, when pine populations expanded around the coring site. Pine needle analysis reveals that Pinus virginiana (Virginia pine) has been present within a few meters of the coring site since ca. 1810, 120 years earlier than previously documented. A dearth of charcoal over the 200-yr period indicates there were no major fires at the coring site after 1820, although small ground fires within a few 10 s of meters cannot be precluded. Mean sedimentation rates between dated horizons reveal that sediment efflux was highest during the early to mid-19 th century (0.51-0.35 cm yr -1), synchronous with active Cr mining activity, and lowest in the past 50 years (0.19 cm yr -1) when the area fell under state management and pine forest expanded. Metal concentrations were highest for Cr and Ni, followed in decreasing order by V, Zn, Cu, and Pb. Results from this study suggest that 1) while Pinus virginiana was present in the early 1 800s in sheltered lowland sites chromite-mining and its erosive effects on soil development may have been a factor in suppressing pine expansion in the Chimney Branch watershed between 1820 and 1920. Hence, pine expansion may be a natural stage in the succession of serpentine vegetation related directly to increasing soil depth, with the pace of expansion influenced by fire or mining disturbance; and 2) variation in Cr concentrations combined with mining history and macrofossils, in conjunction with aerial photos and recent studies, can provide useful stratigraphic dates to establish ecosystem development within the past 200 years in a serpentine environment.","Casey, R.; Hilgartner, W.; Nejako, M.","","136",2009,"Chromium-dating; Macrofossils; Mining disturbance; Pinus virginiana; Sedimentation rates; Serpentine barren; Soldiers Delight history","","","","","","","","",""

The flora and major vegetation types of the western United States have been present for several million years (Leopold &amp; Denton, 1987; Thompson, 1991, 1996). Glacial periods (with low levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide) favored expansions of woodlands and shrublands, whereas full interglacials (which represent a much smaller portion of the past million years) favored the expansion of forests and deserts. Ongoing changes in atmospheric chemistry, climate, and human activities may lead to major vegetation changes over the coming decades to centuries. The combination of observations from the paleoenvironmental record, modern ecological studies, and modeling now permit assessments of the magnitude of potential future changes in the context of natural variability. They also provide opportunities for hypothesis testing and identification of the processes driving past changes in vegetation and climate. Models have been used to simulate potential future changes over the next few decades to centuries. Although models cannot predict future climate changes with accuracy, they do improve understanding of the potential magnitude and direction of future change. Understanding the dynamics of paleoenvironmental change can contribute to current conservation and natural resource management efforts. The paleoenvironmental record clearly indicates that species respond individualistically to climate change (Davis, 1981; Huntley, 1995; Thompson, 1988; Webb, 1995). In response to future climate change, taxa will attempt to track climate and disperse to areas with suitable climate habitat. Appropriate climate conditions for some plant species may disappear entirely from western North America, while other species may be able to expand their ranges. In addition to responding to changes in temperature and precipitation, vegetation will also respond to changes in the concentrations of atmospheric CO2. The combination of warmer temperatures and increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2 may, for example, allow woodland species to replace steppe and grassland species over much of the region and result in more rapid vegetation changes than have occurred in the last several million years. Understanding the dynamics of paleovegetation change will help conservation and natural resource managers anticipate the potential rate, magnitude, and complexity of future vegetation change. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the cases of both forbs and grasses, they were the most common species at the research site. 3. We developed computer programs to track the identity of individual genets based on their spatial locations in the permanent quadrats. The programs distinguished between new recruits and surviving individuals, and calculated the ages and life spans of the survivors. 4. Most herbaceous perennials die young; life expectancy at age 1 year ranged from 0.6 to 6.5. However, forbs are more likely to die young than grasses. Survival from age 1 to 2 years for forbs ranged from 0.11 to 0.49 with an average of 0.30, whereas for grasses it ranged from 0.30 to 0.63 with an average of 0.44.

In order to understand the hydrogeochemical origin and composition of these saline porewaters, we made a detailed geochemical survey of Cl−, SO4 2 −, Br, and I in the porewater, pondwater, and upland groundwater of a typical closed-basin prairie wetland (P1 in the Cottonwood Lake study area, North Dakota). Concentrations of Cl− ranged up to 5.9 mM in the saline porewaters, and was strongly correlated with SO4 2 − and Br (Pearson's r &gt; 0.7, p &lt; 0.05; concentrations ranging up to 131 mM and 39 μM, respectively) due to the conservative effects of surface water evaporation. In contrast, total dissolved I was not significantly correlated with Cl− (Pearson's r = 0.18, p = 0.273) and was concentrated in porewaters located above the saline lenses with a peak concentration of 4.1 μM beneath the center of the wetland— the highest value for dissolved I ever measured in a terrestrial aquatic system and an order of magnitude above that of seawater. We hypothesize that chromatographic separation between more mobile anions (Cl−, SO4 2 −, Br−) and I occurs during droughts when wetland ponds dry and sedimentary iodide (I−) oxidizes to its less-mobile form, iodate (IO3 −).

We characterized genetic diversity at an MHC class II locus (DRB1) in Gunnison's prairie dog (C. gunnisoni) and quantified population genetic structure at the DRB1 versus 12 microsatellite loci in three large Arizona colonies. Two colonies, Seligman (SE) and Espee Ranch (ES), have experienced multiple plague-related die-offs in recent years, whereas plague has never been documented at Aubrey Valley (AV). We found fairly low allelic diversity at the DRB1 locus, with one allele (DRB1*01) at high frequency (0.67-0.87) in all colonies. Two other DRB1 alleles appear to be trans-species polymorphisms shared with the black-tailed prairie dog (C. ludovicianus), indicating that these alleles have been maintained across evolutionary time frames. Estimates of genetic differentiation were generally lower at the MHC locus (FST = 0.033) than at microsatellite markers (FST = 0.098). The reduced differentiation at DRB1 may indicate that selection has been important for shaping variation at MHC loci, regardless of the presence or absence of plague in recent decades. However, genetic drift has probably also influenced the DRB1 locus because its level of differentiation was not different from that of microsatellites in an FST outlier analysis. We then compared specific MHC alleles to plague survivorship in 60 C. gunnisoni that had been experimentally infected with Y. pestis. We found that survival was greater in individuals that carried at least one copy of the most common allele (DRB1*01) compared to those that did not (60% vs. 20%). Although the sample sizes of these two groups were unbalanced, this result suggests the possibility that this MHC class II locus, or a nearby linked gene, could play a role in plague survival. Yersinia pestis leads to nearly 100% mortality in prairie dog (Cynomys spp.) colonies during epizootic events and may have exerted a strong selective force over the past 100 years. We investigated the variation at an important immune system gene, the MHC-DRB1, in three large prairie dog colonies from Arizona.

We found that C. jamaicense seeds and the biomarkers Paq, total lignin phenols (TLP) and kaurenes analyzed from surface soils were all significantly correlated with extant aboveground C. jamaicense biomass quantified along a vegetation gradient from a C. jamaicense to a wet prairie/slough (WPS) community. Our results also suggest that these individual proxies may reflect vegetation over different spatial scales: Paq and kaurenes correlated most strongly (R 2 = 0.88 and 0.99, respectively) with vegetation within 1 m of a soil sample, while seeds and TLP reflected vegetation 0-20 m upstream of soil samples. These differences in the spatial scale depicted by the different proxies may be complementary in understanding aspects of historic landscape patterning. Soil profiles of short (25 cm) cores showed that downcore variation in C. jamaicense seeds was highly correlated with two of the three biomarkers (Paq, R 2 = 0.84, p&lt;0.005; TLP, R 2 = 0.97, p&lt;0.0001), and all four of the proxies indicated a recent increase in C. jamaicense biomass at the site. Using a preliminary depth-to-age relationship based on matching charcoal peaks with available ENP fire records (1980-present) specific to our coring site, we found that peak-depths in C. jamaicense seed concentration appeared to correspond to recent minimum water levels (e.g., 1989 and 2001), and low seed abundance corresponded to high water levels (e.g., 1995), consistent with the known autecology of C. jamaicense. In summary, the combination of C. jamaicense seeds and biomarkers may be useful for paleoecological reconstruction of vegetation change and ultimately in guaging the success of ongoing efforts to restore historic hydrologic conditions in the South Florida Everglades. © Springer 2006.","Childers, D.L.; Gao, M.; Jaffé, R.; Lynch, J.A.; Saunders, C.J.","","569",2006,"Biomarkers; Cladium; Everglades; Paleoecology; Slough","","","","","","","","",""

Paleolimnological studies show that salinity levels in these lakes are tightly linked with climate, and current projections point to a more arid future in the region due to natural and anthropogenic climate change, potentially influencing lake salinity. Many zooplankton species are sensitive to changes in salinity, and their position near the base of the aquatic food web makes it important to understand how they might respond to increasing salinity levels. Zooplankton communities in lakes with rising salinity levels may exhibit changes in structure, including a shift toward more salinity-tolerant species and a reduction in abundance, species richness, and diversity. However, it is possible that dispersal of zooplankton among lakes could mitigate such community changes when migrant populations replace sensitive zooplankton with those that are locally adapted to higher salinities. To test if dispersal could reduce salinity-induced changes in zooplankton communities, we ran a field enclosure experiment at a freshwater lake in southern Saskatchewan where we manipulated salinity levels and zooplankton dispersal. We evaluated how salinity and dispersal influenced species identities and relative abundances (community structure) using multivariate statistics and comparing taxonomic and functional compositions among the different treatments (richness, diversity, and evenness). We found that increasing salinity levels in our enclosures above that in our study lake resulted in lower zooplankton abundances and species richness levels, primarily due to the loss of cladoceran species. However, patterns in our multivariate analyses suggested that cladocerans were maintained in enclosures with salinity levels of 2.5 and 5.0 g/L when those enclosures received immigration from nearby lakes. In contrast, our univariate analyses failed to find evidence that immigration affected community structure (richness, diversity, evenness). The lack of significant statistical differences could suggest that dispersal does not have an effect, or it may have been a problem with statistical power, as a power analysis suggested that fairly large effect sizes would have been required to achieve statistical significance. Based on our results, we were unable to reach a definitive conclusion on the role that dispersal might play in buffering zooplankton communities against salinity-driven changes. However, our study provides two important insights for planning future work. First, our power analyses indicated that more replication may be needed given the variability among our experimental enclosures. Second, the patterns in our multivariate analyses suggested that cladocerans could be maintained in lakes undergoing salinity increases if they receive immigration from surrounding lakes with higher salinities. Future work examining how inter- and intraspecific salinity tolerance varies across lakes with a gradient of salinities would be helpful for understanding the role that dispersal might play in buffering against salinity-driven losses of cladoceran zooplankton. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Gray, D.K.; Huynh, M.","","65",2020,"Prairies; climate change; endorheic lakes; plankton; salinisation","","","","","","","","",""

Although range expansions in pinyon-juniper populations have been documented with changing climate throughout the Holocene, over the last century, local scale impacts such as livestock grazing, changes in fire regimes, and increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are thought to be more recent drivers of pinyon-juniper woodland distribution. Our objective was to examine the role of historical livestock grazing relative to past climate in regulating pinyon (Pinus edulis Engelm.) recruitment and growth over the last century in a persistent pinyon-juniper woodland. We compared pinyon dynamics on a remote mesa site, minimally grazed by domestic livestock, to a nearby historically grazed site in southeastern Utah. The presence of a significant number of old trees (&gt;200 yr) at both sites suggests that these populations were well established prior to the 20th century. No differences in pinyon density or basal area were observed between grazed and ungrazed sites. Stand age structure data showed that pinyon recruitment across these sites was highly synchronous, with a large recruitment event occurring during the early 1900s; 17 of the pinyons on both sites dated to the 1920s. Climatic conditions during this decade were consistently cool and wet-conditions known to support enhanced recruitment and growth in pinyon pines. Pinyon growth was also strongly synchronous across sites (r0.96). Pinyon growth was significantly correlated with winter/spring precipitation and negatively correlated with June temperature. Taken together, our results suggest that past climate may be more important in structuring pinyon populations than historical land use in these persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands. Given future climate projections of increasing temperature and more extended drought periods, regeneration of pinyon populations following the recent regional-scale dieback may be slow. Moreover, prolonged drought combined with potentially slow regeneration times for pinyon under future climate scenarios could result in substantial declines in pinyon populations across the region, a result that land managers should consider when planning for future restoration treatments in persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands. © Society for Range Management.","Adams, H.D.; Asner, G.P.; Barger, N.N.; Neff, J.C.; Woodhouse, C.","","62",2009,"Age structure; Climate change; Grand StaircaseEscalante National Monument; Land use change; Pinyon; Tree growth; Tree ring; Woodland expansion; Woody encroachment","","","","","","","","",""

This system approach is based, in principal, on unity of groundwater and surface water systems, and it is in stark contrast to the traditional deterministic approach based on modeling. In coordination with methodology of system analysis, two levels of study were used to estimate subsurface flow. First, the global stream runoff data were assessed to estimate the temporal-spatial variability of surface water runoff. Factor analysis was used to study the temporal-spatial variability of global runoff for the period from 1918 to 1967. Results of these analysis demonstrate that the variability of global runoff could be represented by seven major components (factor scores) that could be grouped into seven distinct independent grouping from the total of 18 continental slopes on the Earth. Computed variance value in this analysis is 76% and supports such analysis. The global stream runoff for this period is stationary, and is more closely connected with the stream flow of Asia to the Pacific Ocean as well as with the stream runoff of North America towards the Arctic and Pacific Oceans. The second level examines the distribution of river runoff (annual and for February) for various landscapes and the hydrogeological conditions in the State of Minnesota (218,000 km2). The annual and minimal monthly rate of stream runoff for 115 gauging stations with a period of observation of 47 years (1935-1981) were used to characterize the spatio-temporal distribution of stream runoff in Minnesota. Results of this analysis demonstrate that the annual stream runoff rate changes from 6.3, towards 3.95, and then to 2.09 1 s-1 km-2 (the difference is significant based on Student's criteria). These values in Minnesota correspond to ecological provinces from a mixed forest province towards the broadleaf forest and to prairie province, respectively. The distribution of minimal monthly stream runoff rate (February runoff) is controlled by hydrogeological systems in Minnesota. The difference between the two hydrogeological regions, Precambrian crystalline basement and Paleozoic artesian basin of 0.83 and 2.09 1/s/km2, is statistically significant. Within these regions, the monthly minimal runoff (0.5 and 1.68, and 0.87 and 3.11 1 s-1 km-2 for February, respectively) is also distinctly different for delineated subregions, depending on whether or not the Quaternary cover is present. The spatio-temporal structure that emerges could thus be used to generate river runoff and subsurface flow maps at any scale - from the global level to local detail. Such analysis was carried out in Minnesota with the detailed mapping of the subsurface flow for the Twin Cities Metropolitan area.","Kanivetsky, R.; Shmagin, B.A.","","42",2002,"Groundwater runoff; Hierarchical hydrogeological flow fields; Hydrological databases of regions and continents; Subsurface flow mapping","","","","","","","","",""

The three ecosystems represented a tropical grassland dominated by C4 species (the Serengeti of Africa), a temperate grassland dominated by a mixture of C3 and C4 species (Flooding Pampa of South America), and a northern temperate grassland dominated by C3 species (Yellowstone National Park of North America). Plants were grown in growth chambers under common conditions to compare relative responses to grazing and elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 caused an increase in total biomass and total productivity (biomass + clippings) only in Yellowstone species, and increases in growth occurred primarily in crowns and roots (storage organs). There were no significant CO2 effects on biomass or productivity in Serengeti or Flooding Pampa species, and no CO2 effects on aboveground biomass or productivity (aboveground biomass + clippings) in species from any of the three ecosystems. Since aboveground plant parts are the portions that are available to grazing mammals, this suggests that increased atmospheric CO2 may not affect food quantity in these three grasslands. There was no interaction between CO2 and defoliation for any species; thus, it appears that herbivores will not affect how grasses respond to elevated CO2 (at least under average nutrient conditions). Elevated CO2 caused a reduction in leaf percentage of N in species from Yellowstone and Flooding Pampa (especially the C3 species, Briza subaristata), but not in Serengeti species. Because the quantity of food was unaffected by the CO2 treatments and forage N was reduced, grazing mammals in Yellowstone (elk, Cervus elaphus, and bison, Bison bison) and the Flooding Pampa (cattle) may be negatively affected. Responses to defoliation were fairly consistent among ecosystems in aboveground productivity, which did not differ between defoliated and undefoliated plants, and in leaf water potentials and percentage of N, both of which increased in response to defoliation. However, differences among ecosystems were found for crown and root biomass in response to defoliation: Serengeti species, on average, had higher crown and similar root biomasses after defoliation, whereas defoliated species from the other two ecosystems had reduced crown and root biomass. We suggest that the lower intensity and increased temporal variance in grazing pressure in Yellowstone vs. the Serengeti, selected for plants that shift allocation away from roots and crowns in order to compensate for aboveground herbivory.","Coleman, J.S.; Mcnaughton, S.J.; Wilsey, B.J.","","7",1997,"CO2 enrichment; Global change; Grasslands; Grazing; Herbivory","","","","","","","","",""

The exact nature of megaherbivores' role can be studied using a relatively new suite of palaeoecological techniques, including the quantification of fossil spores from Sporormiella and other coprophilous fungi as indicators of megafaunal biomass in sediment records. However, a quantitative linkage of spore abundance with megaherbivore biomass or grazing intensity has been lacking. Konza Prairie Biological Station (Kansas, USA), located in the midcontinent of North America, contains native tallgrass prairie grazed by a herd of bison (Bison bison) in a 1000-ha enclosure, providing an excellent opportunity to test the effects of megaherbivores on grassland community composition and their potential signature in the palynological record. We collected pollen and spores during 2009 and 2010 from a network of 28 modified Tauber traps. The precise locations of the bison herd were recorded using GPS collars; we calculated bison grazing intensity (kg m-2 year-1) to high spatial precision within concentric circles around each trap (radii from 25 to 500 m). Both relative (per cent) and absolute (concentration) abundances of Sporormiella were significantly higher in traps inside the enclosure and were positively correlated with bison grazing intensity. The cut-off for distinguishing between bison-grazed and ungrazed traps was determined to be 2.8% Sporormiella of the total pollen and spore sum, consistent with previous palaeoecological reconstructions. The relationship between Sporormiella abundances and available grazing area around each trap was strongest at short radii (25-100 m), suggesting that spores do not disperse far from their source. Sporormiella should thus be considered a local-scale indicator of megaherbivore presence. Traps in the grazed area had significantly higher percentages of Ambrosia and lower percentages of Poaceae pollen than traps from ungrazed areas. This suggests that the pollen record has the potential to detect the ecological effects of bison grazing on grassland community composition. Synthesis. This study refines the use of Sporormiella as a proxy for local megaherbivore presence, especially in grassland systems. Multiproxy Sporormiella and pollen analyses may help elucidate the past drivers of grassland dynamics, including the possible role of bison in mediating grass-forb interactions during the variable moisture regimes of the last 12,000 years. © 2013 British Ecological Society.","Gill, J.L.; Goring, S.; Mclauchlan, K.K.; Skibbe, A.M.; Williams, J.W.; Zirbel, C.R.","","101",2013,"Coprophilous fungi; Extinction; Grasslands; Non-pollen palynomorphs; Palaeoecology and land use history; Palynology; Plant-herbivore interactions; Pleistocene megafauna","","","","","","","","",""

Major ions and trace metals were determined in precipitation-event and snow-core samples from sites along a 600 km transect from the North Dakota prairie to the forests of northeastern Minnesota, collected during the period April 1978-June 1979. Acidity increased 4-fold from west to east as the effect of alkaline dust and NH3 decreased with increasing distance from the cultivated prairie; calcium and Mg2+ decreased 2 to 3-fold across the transect. However, minimum concentrations of NH4+ and SO42- were observed at Itasca, the central site. Natural emissions of these elements were important in the west, while anthropogenic emissions were responsible for the higher concentrations in the east. Wet deposition of H+ decreased 8-fold and deposition of NO3- and SO42- decreased 1.5 to 2-fold from Hovland in the east to Tewaukon in the west. Wet deposition of the metal cations increased from Hovland to Tewaukon. Dry deposition followed a similar trend. Winter snow cover and freezing temperatures, which decreased airborne soil dust and the evolution of NH3 from the prairie soils, led to an increase in precipitation acidity at all sites. The acid increase was accompanied by a decrease in alkaline metal cations, especially Ca2+, and in NH4+. At Hovland SO42- and NO3- also increased during the winter. The occurrence of snow events at Tewaukon that were appreciably more acid than the snowpack accumulated there indicates that snow was neutralized after it fell by alkaline dust entrained in resuspended snow, or deposited separately. Winter inputs of acid are especially important because they are released during a short period in the spring. Over half of the acid input at Hovland occurred during the winter. Precipitation inputs of P and N probably benefit nutrient-poor ecosystems in the north-central United States. However, acid precipitation at Hovland is approaching levels known to cause adverse effects in sensitive regions. The geology of northeastern Minnesota, adjoining Ontario, and northern Wisconsin is similar to that in areas where lake acidification and losses of fish populations have occurred, so that such problems may eventually occur in central North America. © 1982.","Munger, J.W.","","16",1982,"","","","","","","","","",""

The river's relatively pristine condition led to its designation as a National Scenic Riverway in 1968, but increasing urbanization in its lower reaches has raised concerns about impacts on water quality. This study was initiated to reconstruct historical loadings of suspended sediment and phosphorus (P) from the sediment record in Lake St. Croix. Twenty-four piston cores, with an average length of 2 m, were collected along eight transects of the lake. Dated chronologies from 210Pb, 137Cs and 14C were used to calculate the rate of sediment accumulation in the lake over the past 100+ years. Diatom microfossil analysis was used to reconstruct historical lakewater P concentrations over the same time period, and sediment P analysis quantified the amount of P trapped in lake sediments. Using a whole-lake mass balance approach, the loading of sediment and P to Lake St. Croix over the last 100+ years was calculated. Beginning in 1850, sediment accumulation increased dramatically to a peak in 1950-1960 of eight times background rates prior to European settlement. The peak is driven largely by sediment contributions from small side-valley catchment tributaries to the downstream half of the lake. The total P load to the lake increased sharply after 1940 and remains high, at around four times the level of pre-European settlement conditions. The timing of peak sediment and P loading to the lake shows that early settlement activities, such as logging and the conversion of forest and prairie to agricultural land between 1850 and 1890, had only modest impacts on the lake. By contrast, the mid-1900s brought major increases in sediment and P loading to the lake, suggesting that relatively recent activities on the landscape and changes to nutrient balances in the watershed have caused the current eutrophic condition of this important recreational and natural resource. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Edlund, M.B.; Engstrom, D.R.; Triplett, L.D.","","41",2009,"Human impact; Mississippi River; Paleolimnology; Phosphorus loading; Sediment loading; St. Croix River","","","","","","","","",""

This review is primarily based on literature from the last 60 years on desert bighorn sheep (O. c. nelsoni), Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (O. c. canadensis), and mountain lion (Puma concolor) predation. Although, many predators kill bighorn sheep, only mountain lions are currently considered to be the primary proximate cause of mortality for many bighorn sheep populations. The ultimate cause of this phenomenon has vexed wildlife managers for >40 years. There are 3 primary reasons for increased predation on bighorn sheep by mountain lions. First, there is an increased presence of mountain lions in habitats where they were historically absent or rare because of the expansion of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) following the extensive conversion of fire-maintained grasslands to shrublands in the late-1800s. Second, is the extirpation of the 2 dominant apex carnivores (wolves [Canis lupus] and grizzly bears [Ursus arctos]) during this same time period and a hypothesized numerical response of mountain lions to those extirpations. Finally, the response of mountain lions to the cessation of >70 years of intensive predator control has often resulted in unsustainable mountain lion-bighorn sheep ratios, especially for desert bighorn sheep. Additionally, the effect of mountain lion predation is exacerbated by declines in bighorn sheep that do not result in declines in mountain lions because of their ability to prey switch to mule deer, elk (Cervus canadensis), or domestic cattle; kleptoparasitism of mountain lions kills, by ursids and canids, resulting in higher kill rates for mountain lions; and a possible ecological trap where adaptations derived over evolutionary time are no longer adaptive because of human-induced changes in the sympatric apex predator guild. Control of mountain lions, when mountain lion-ungulate ratios are high, might be required to protect small or endangered bighorn sheep populations, and to produce bighorn sheep for restoration efforts. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017","Rominger, E.M.","","82",2018,"Native American fire; apparent competition; bighorn sheep; ecological trap; kleptoparasitism; mountain lion; predation; predator control; predator-prey ratio","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is relatively good biostratigraphic and climatic information for the late Lujanian and Platan local ages (latest Pleistocene to Holocene) of the Pampas region. Most of the climatic data from the Pampean area are based on land mammal assemblages, pollen records, and geology. Contrasting with North American faunal associations, there are many non-analogue assemblages in the Holocene of the Pampean area. The climate was arid and relatively cold during most of the early Lujanian. However, several relatively wet and warm events are suggested by the presence of subtropical mammals and evidence of tchernozoid paleosoils. The late Lujanian is well represented by the fossiliferous sediments of the La Chumbiada and Guerrero members of the Lujan Formation (ca. 30,000 and 21,000-13,000 yr B.P., respectively), cropping out in stream valleys in the Buenos Aires Province. Mammal assemblages suggest a change from a temperate to a cool climate from the La Chumbiada Member to the Guerrero Member, the latter representing the last glacial maximum. The lower portion of the eolian La Postrera Formation has been dated at 11,000-8000 yr B.P. This section was deposited on basin divides under dry and cool conditions. The mammal association was similar to that of the Gueffero Member and includes the last megaherbivore mammals in South America (e.g. Megatherium americanum). Mammals occurring in Platan beds usually indicate dry but not cool conditions. Warm and probably wetter conditions were detected in continental beds deposited synchronously with a mid-Holocene marginal marine ingression (ca. 7000-6000 yr B.P.). A Holocene non-analogue assemblage of subtropical mammals and dry/cold indicators occurred at latitude 38°30'S at ca. 2000 yr B.P. Subtropical mammals that require wetter conditions have been migrating southwards in the Pampean region since 1500-1000 yr B.P. Eolian sediments in the La Postrera Formation dated ca. 440 yr B.P. yielded an arid to semiarid mammal assemblage which could relate to the Little Ice Age period. Remarkably, most of the present-day manual biocenoses and climatic conditions in the Pampas seem to have been recently established.

Location : Georgia (Caucasus region). Methods : Pollen data were assembled from various sources and used to map: (1) changing frequencies of individual taxa; (2) vegetation changes; and (3) reconstructed climatic parameters for the past 14,000 years. Numerical analyses were performed using two-way indicator species analysis (twinspan), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), the modern analogue technique (MAT) and weighted averaging (WA). Results : Mapping of pollen taxa showed that Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia and Ephedra were most abundant in the study area during the late-glacial. Betula and Corylus expanded during the early Holocene, yielding to Abies, Carpinus, Fagus, Quercus and Castanea. Picea, Pinus, Juglans and Ostrya-type expanded during the late Holocene. Mixed forests grew in the moist, Black Sea refugium throughout the late Quaternary. Elsewhere in Georgia, the Pleistocene-Holocene transition is recorded as a shift from desert-steppes to oak-xerophyte communities and mixed forests. This kind of vegetation remained relatively stable until the mid-late Holocene, when coniferous forests and mountain grasslands advanced. DCA showed that rainfall was most strongly correlated with pollen composition in the study area (r 2 = 0.55). No temperature signal was detected. A weighted-averaging transfer function linking pollen percentages to annual precipitation was selected over a MAT model as it performed better when applied to a validation data set. Rainfall reconstructions indicate widespread aridity at the terminal Pleistocene, followed by a gradual increase in precipitation, peaking during the mid Holocene (7000-4000 cal. yr bp) and generally decreasing thereafter. Main conclusions : On a regional scale, the results confirm those from previous studies of palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate in Western Asia. On a local scale, reconstructions from individual sites often diverge from the regional trend because of edaphic changes, ecological succession, human impacts and other disturbances. Some of these factors are probably responsible for the increasing heterogeneity of Georgia's vegetation in the latter half of the Holocene. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Connor, S.E.; Kvavadze, E.V.","","36",2009,"Caucasus; Geographic information systems; Georgia; Holocene; Modelling; Palaeoclimate; Palaeovegetation; Palynology; Refugia","","","","","","","","",""

The activities of past human populations have led to continuous alterations of the landscape, creating new ecological niches and habitats. Ethnohistorical and ethnographic documents have furnished some evidence for these activities. Plains Indians, for example, may have been responsible for deforestation in central North America (Wells 1970b). Similar forest destruction has been proposed for the Piedmont region in the southeastern United States. Here, Native Americans repeatedly burned off large portions of forestland to create grazing lands for deer populations (Hudson 1976:19). Additional sources suggest that burning forests and brush was a hunting technique used to concentrate game in one area for killing (Hudson 1976:19). Forest growth is further affected by cutting wood for fuel (Dimbleby 1978:53) and in the establishment of footpaths used for trading, hunting, and gathering (Ellen 1989:23). All of these human activities have altered the environment (Ellen 1989), but probably the most detrimental human behavior affecting the prehistoric southeastern United States was the process of clearing land for maize cultivation. Globally, the process of plant cultivation has led to enormou s changes in the s tru cture o f biotic associations. Field clearance alone has actuated the destruction of forests and native grasslands as well as other natural habitats (Ellen 1989:22-23). This paper examines the application of a small-mammal model to document prehistoric environmental change in the Black Belt physiographic region in Mississippi. The study's major emphasis is on documenting changes in small-mammal faunas in response to prehistoric agricultural clearing. To assess these changes, a small-mammal model is developed and applied to archaeological faunal assemblages recovered from the Black Belt region of east-central Mississippi and westcentral Alabama. Previous works by Scott (1982, 1983), where smallmammal data were used for environmental reconstruction, provide a basic framework for developing the model used in this study. Habitat preferences for small mammals indigenous to the study area are included in the model. The small-mammal model is then applied to assess possible environmental changes for two small Mississippianperiod (a.d. 1000-1540) sites located in the Black Prairie physiographic zone: the Josey Farm site (22OK793) (Rafferty and Hogue 1999) located just north of Starkville, and the Yarborough site (22CL814) located in nearby Clay County (Solis and Walling 1982). © 2003 by University of Alabama Press.

Stable carbon isotope data were derived from soils and vegetation on the near-pristine, C4-dominated grassland of the Konza Tallgrass Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in northeastern Kansas. In order to evaluate variation of δ13C within the landscape, two levels of sampling were employed: 2 m-deep upland cores extracted to assess variation with depth in the soil profile, and, to assess variability across the landscape, surface samples along two transects and from within a 660×690 m grid. For transect and grid points, both the upper 2 cm of sediment and the aboveground biomass were collected. Core samples taken at Konza reveal that soil organic carbon was depleted in 13C within the upper 10-20 cm relative to the remainder of the soil solum below, a phenomenon previously reported. In transects and the sample grid, soil organic carbon from soil surfaces was consistently more depleted in 13C than aboveground tissue of associated vegetation samples. Slope, azimuth, and insolation were computed from field data and a high-resolution DEM of the sample grid, but these variables offered no significant explanation of the spatial variability in δ13C data from soil organic carbon. The observation that modern landscape position has little effect on δ13C over short distances, at least in a C4-dominated community, lends support to the application of δ13C analysis to buried soils for paleoenvironmental reconstruction where paleolandscape position is often unknown. Stable carbon isotope data were derived from paleosols at from the Beisel-Steinle site located to the west of Konza in central Kansas. Three soils were examined: the interstadial paleosol within the Gilman Canyon Formation (c. 38-27k cal yr BP), the Late Pleistocene-Holocene Brady Soil, and the modern surface soil. With the exception of isotopic depletion at the top of the surface soil, all three soils exhibited similar δ13C values of about14‰, the same value realized in the soil cores from Konza, suggesting close similarity among the plant communities of the interstade, the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene transition, and pristine prairie of today. This investigation emphasizes the need for additional research into the variation in stable carbon isotope signals vertically within the profile and across the landscape. Issues include the source of the near-surface depletion zone, the relationship between isotopic values in the soil versus those of the vegetation, and variation in soil δ13C values δ13C throughout the landscape. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Johnson, W.C.; Macpherson, G.L.; Willey, K.L.","","162-163",2007,"","","","","","","","","",""

Reclamation of this human footprint is only a first step towards ecological recovery. A trait-based approach may provide a mechanistic understanding of biological and edaphic filters influencing longer-term plant community assembly on reclaimed sites. Using taxonomic indices, trait community weighted means (CWM), and functional diversity (FDQ) combined with multivariate models, we compared biological and edaphic properties of 18 reclaimed well pads in Alberta (Canada), to proximate native grasslands. These well pads were certified reclaimed under two reclamation criteria (old, new). Consistent with practices in other regions, newer criteria emphasize using native plant species in place of historically-used introduced agronomic species. We found significant differences between reclaimed and undisturbed reference soil properties (e.g., pH, electrical conductivity), with greater differences on sites reclaimed using the older criteria (e.g., lower TOC, higher bulk density). Plant trait composition also differed between reclaimed and undisturbed sites, with a lower prevalence of short, native, xeric species, with semi-abundant seed production and large seed weight on reclaimed sites. We found a strong trait-environment relationship underlying trait composition difference. While not significantly different in overall trait composition from new sites, old sites included higher prevalence of introduced species, dispersed by animals, preferring mesic conditions, and high seed production. The increased cover of introduced species reduced trait FDQ and led to an arrested succession. New sites included higher prevalence of tall, native species preferring hydric conditions, therophytes, geophytes, and species with low dispersal capacity. The use of native seed with higher FDQ on new sites seemed to alleviate arrested succession; However, biological trait filters (e.g., tall, hydric preference) and altered edaphic properties, might continue to drive differences between reclaimed and reference sites. Our results suggest that even as practices and policies evolve, reclamation does not fully alleviate the legacy effects of this industrial disturbance. We have demonstrated how trait-based approaches can inform recovery assessment and future reclamation best practices. We must go beyond simply seeding with native species for recovery of plant communities – the traits of these native species matter too. © 2019 The Authors","Aubin, I.; Azeria, E.T.; Lupardus, R.C.; McIntosh, A.C.S.; Santala, K.","","5",2020,"Exotics; Functional diversity; Grassland; Industrial disturbance; Introduced forage; Legacy effects; Plant traits; Soil quality; Succession","","","","","","","","",""

The δ13C values of bulk and serial enamel samples from large mammals show a wide range of variation from -13.3‰ to 1.4‰, with a mean of -7.4‰±3.5‰ (n=294). This indicates that large herbivorous mammals in the area had a variety of diets since 6.5Ma, ranging from pure C3 to mixed C3-C4 and pure C4 diets. In contrast, the δ13C values of small mammals vary from -11.9‰ to -7.6‰, with a mean of -9.7±1.1‰ (n=17), indicating that rodents and ochotonids were feeding mostly on C3 plants. Variations in δ13C values within and between species reflect the variations in the habitat and the vegetation consumed by the animals. In general, horses had higher amounts of C4 grasses in their diets than other contemporary taxa such as bovids, rhinos, rodents and deer, suggesting that horses exploited more open habitats such as grasslands while deer, rhinos and rodents may have preferred more C3 vegetation, which is more indicative of forested environments. The carbon isotope data show that C4 grasses have been an important component of horses' diets and of local ecosystems since ~6.5Ma, confirming that the ""late Miocene C4 expansion"" occurred in North China as it did in Africa, Indian subcontinent and the Americas. This supports a global factor as a main driver of the late Miocene C4 expansion. The combined carbon and oxygen isotope data reveal major shifts in climate to drier and/or warmer conditions after ~5.8, ~4.1, ~3.3, and ~2.5Ma, and significant shifts to relatively wetter and/or cooler conditions after ~6.4, ~5, ~3.5Ma. The shifts to drier and/or warmer climate after ~5.8Ma and ~2.5Ma coincide with two major fauna turnover events. Intra-tooth δ13C and δ18O values are negatively correlated within individual modern teeth and some fossil teeth, displaying the characteristic pattern of the summer monsoon regime and confirming a strong monsoon influence in the area since at least the early Pliocene. The data also suggest that the C4 abundance in the area has fluctuated over the past 6.5Ma in response to changes in climate, with more C4 grasses during warmer and/or drier periods and a reduced C4 component at cooler and/or wetter times. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Ciner, B.; Deng, T.; Flynn, L.; Hou, S.; Wang, Y.; Wu, W.","","440",2015,"Carbon isotopes; Oxygen isotopes; Paleodiet; Paleoenvironment; Tooth enamel; Yushe Basin","","","","","","","","",""

Although the majority of organic carbon in these ecosystems resides belowground, there is no consensus on how this change in land cover has affected soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) pools. The degree to which duration of woody plant occupation, climate, and edaphic conditions have mediated SOC and TN responses to changes in life-form composition are poorly understood. We addressed these issues at a desert grassland site in Arizona, USA, where the leguminous shrub velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina) has proliferated along an elevation/precipitation/ temperature gradient and on contrasting soil morphologic surfaces. On sandy loam complexes of mid-Holocene origin, mean SOC and TN of soils in the grassland matrix increased ∼68% and ∼45%, respectively, with increasing elevation. Soil organic carbon pools were comparable and TN pools were ∼23% higher in Pleistocene-aged clay loam complexes co-occurring with Holocene-aged soils at the upper elevation/climatic zone. Across the site, belowground resources associated with large Prosopis plants were 21-154% (SOC) and 18-127% (TN) higher than those in the grassy matrix. The variance in SOC and TN pools accounted for by Prosopis stem size (a rough surrogate for time of site occupation) was highest at the low- and mid-elevation sites (69-74%) and lowest at the upper elevation site (32-38%). Soil δ15N values ranged from 5.5‰ to 6.7‰ across the soil/elevation zones but were comparable in herbaceous and shrub-impacted soils and exhibited a weak relationship with Prosopis basal stem diameter (r2, 0.1) and TN (r2, 0.08). The SOC δ13C values decreased linearly with increasing Prosopis basal diameter, suggesting that size and isotopic composition of the SOC pool is a function of time of Prosopis site occupation. Isotopic mixture models indicate that encroachment of C3 woody plants has also promoted SOC additions from C4 plant sources, indicative of long-term herbaceous facilitation. Grassy sites in contrasting soil/elevation combinations, initially highly distinctive in their SOC pool size and δ13C, appear to be converging on similar values following ∼100 years of woody plant proliferation. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Archer, S.R.; Asner, G.P.; McMurtry, C.R.; Wheeler, C.W.","","17",2007,"13C; Carbon cycle; Carbon isotopes; Carbon sequestration; Mesquite; Prosopis velutina; Santa Rita experimental range, Arizona, USA; Soil nitrogen; Soil organic carbon; Sonoran desert; Woody plant encroachment","","","","","","","","",""

They did not become abundant until around 7 Ma. One can analyse stable carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotope values in the enamel of fossil horse teeth to determine the extent to which horses were eating C4 grasses even during the period before those grasses became abundant. Questions: In southern California, what proportion of a middle Miocene horse's diet was made up of C4 grasses? Was the amount enough to influence the size and shape of horse teeth? Organisms: Eighty-five specimens of five fossil horse species - Acritohippus stylodontus, Archaeohippus mourningi, Merychippus californicus, Scaphohippus intermontanus, and Scaphohippus sumani - from the middle Miocene (c. 16 Ma) of southern California (i.e. Barstow Formation, Cajon Valley Formation, and Temblor Formation). Methods: To determine if C4 grasses were present in middle Miocene horse diets, we analysed stable carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotope values from the enamel of the fossils. If the result did indicate C4 foraging at a locality, we modelled the percentage of C4 grasses in equid diets using Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) v.4.2.2. Results: Modelled percentage C4 in equid diets was &lt;20%. Each formation was statistically significantly different from the others in terms of δ13C values. Barstow specimens had the highest values, those from Cajon Valley the lowest, and those from Temblor were intermediate. Those results indicate that horses ate C4 grasses within the Barstow and possibly the Temblor Formation but not the Cajon Valley Formation. Within the Barstow sample, Scaphohippus sumani had statistically significantly lower δ13C but statistically significantly higher δ18O values than Acritohippus stylodontus, suggesting a higher proportion of C3 grasses in the diet of Scaphohippus sumani versus a higher proportion of C4 grasses for Acritohippus stylodontus. The latter species also had higher tooth crowns, consistent with a diet richer in C4 grasses. There were no statistically significant differences between species at Cajon Valley for either δ13C or δ18O. The δ13C values for Merychippus californicus suggest that the habitats of the Temblor Formation had a low percentage (&lt;6%) of C4 plants. Conclusions: C4 grasses lived in the mid-Miocene landscape in southern California up to 8 million years before the rapid increase in C4 ecosystems that occurred worldwide about 7 to 5 Ma. Horses foraged these grasses, so hypotheses related to horse morphological evolution must take C4 plants into account. © 2017 Robert S.

Conglomerates of the middle Eocene Clarno Formation near Clarno contain largely weakly developed paleosols compatible with an environment of volcanic lahars around a large stratovolcano. Deeply weathered paleosols (Ultisols) around a volcanic dome and overlying these conglomerates indicate a climate that was subtropical (mean annual temperature or MAT 23-25°C) and humid (mean annual precipitation or MAP of 900-2,000 mm). Comparable paleoclimates are indicated by fossil floras from the conglomerates, which show diversity and adaptive features similar to modern vegetation of Volcan San Martin, Mexico. An erosional disconformity in the Clarno area separates these older beds from less deeply weathered red paleosols (Alfisols) in the middle Eocene upper Clarno Formation. The change in paleosols may represent a decline in both temperature (MAT 19-23°C) and rainfall (MAP 900-1,350 mm), with dry seasons. Strongly developed lateritic paleosols (Oxisols and Ultisols) in the uppermost Clarno and lowermost John Day Formations in the Painted Hills record return to more humid conditions during the late Eocene. These paleosols are similar to soils of southern Mexico and Central America in climates that are subtropical (MAT 23-25°C) and humid (MAP 900-2,000 mm). Kaolinitic and iron-rich, red paleosols (Ultisols) of the lower Big Basin Member of the John Day Formation near Clarno and the Painted Hills are erosionally truncated and abruptly overlain by smectitic and tuffaceous paleosols (Inceptisols and Alfisols) of the middle Big Basin Member. This truncation surface can be correlated with the local Eocene-Oligocene boundary. Paleosols of the middle Big Basin Member are most like those of the Central Transmexican Volcanic Belt and indicate an early Oligocene paleoclimate appreciably cooler (MAT 16-18°C) and drier (MAP 600-1,200 mm) than during the late Eocene. Root traces and clay accumulations in the paleosols indicate forest vegetation, also evident from fossil leaves of the lake-margin Bridge Creek flora. The mid-Oligocene upper Big Basin Member of the John Day Formation includes distinctive brown as well as red paleosols (Alfisols). Its paleosols indicate a paleoclimate drier (MAP 500-700 mm) than before, and more grasses in the forest understory. Another erosional truncation marks the base of the late Oligocene (early Arikareean), olive-brown lower Turtle Cove Member of the John Day Formation. Calcareous paleosols with near-granular soil structure (Inceptisols and Aridisols) indicate an even drier (MAP 400-600 mm) climate, more open grassy woodland vegetation than previously, and local wooded grassland of seasonally wet bottomlands. The Clarno-John Day sequence preserves a long-term paleoclimatic record that complements the geological record of global change from deep sea cores and fossil plants. Similarly, it reveals stepwise climatic cooling and drying, with a particularly dramatic climatic deterioration at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary.","Bestland, E.A.; Fremd, T.J.; Retallack, G.J.","","344",1999,"","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is limited knowledge about the controls on plant wax integration and transport in large catchments with multiple biomes and climates. To address this lack of understanding, we investigated the vegetation and climatic controls on plant wax integration and transport from the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), the largest river in the U.S., to the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). We first estimated the geographic distribution of n-alkane carbon (δ13Calk) and hydrogen (δ2Halk) isotopic compositions (i.e. isoscapes) in the MRB using plant isotope fractionation calibrations from North America and similar climate regions for the pre-industrial. We utilized two different vegetation maps (i.e. biome map and %C4 map) and two plant isotope fractionation estimation approaches, and discussed advantages and disadvantages of each method. Then, we developed mixing models weighting the isotope values by biological and climatic parameters (i.e. vegetation area, n-alkane concentration by chain lengths, net primary productivity (NPP), and runoff) and their combinations to test the sensitivity of basin-integrated plant wax isotopic compositions to these variables. Our approach does not factor in soil stocks of plant wax nor degradation in transit, as future work will need to constrain these factors for the MRB for the period of interest. Vegetation area weighting alone predicted relatively high C4 plant contributions to the pool of waxes exported from the basin. When n-alkane concentration in leaves, NPP, or runoff was considered, the contribution of forest-derived plant waxes increased. Sensitivity of plant wax isotopic compositions to productivity and transport efficiency varied among models and chain lengths. For example, n-C29 alkanes were sensitive to plant wax contribution increases from forests whereas n-C33 alkanes were more sensitive to increases in C4 grassland productivity. The plant wax concentration and NPP were combined as an estimate for total wax productivity, and a combination of this total wax productivity and runoff were used to simulate both production and transport. These multi-parameter models estimated the highest plant wax contribution from C3 forests because these areas were calculated to have the highest productivity and greatest runoff. Despite large differences in δ13Calk and δ2Halk values across the MRB, variation in the predicted δ13C and δ2H of exported n-alkanes is small across all models. This small range is consistent with a calculated predominance of plant wax export from wet and tree-dominated biomes and suggests that drier and C4 grass-dominated biomes may be under-represented in the sedimentary plant wax record. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bowen, G.J.; Cotton, J.M.; Diefendorf, A.F.; Ju, S.-J.; Suh, Y.J.","","257",2019,"Biomarker proxies; C3; C4; Compound-specific δ13C; Compound-specific δ2H; Spatial analysis; n-Alkane","","","","","","","","",""

Spatially heterogeneous fire and grazing create heterogeneity in vegetation structure at the landscape level (patch contrast) and increase rangeland biodiversity. We analysed five experiments comparing spatially heterogeneous fire treatments to spatially homogeneous fire treatments on grazed rangeland along a precipitation gradient in the North American Great Plains. 2.We predicted that, across the precipitation gradient, management for heterogeneity increases both patch contrast and variance in the composition of plant functional groups. Furthermore, we predicted that patch contrast is positively correlated with variance in plant functional group composition. Because fire spread is important to the fire-grazing interaction, we discuss factors that reduce fire spread and reduce patch contrast despite management for heterogeneity. 3.We compared patch contrast across pastures managed for heterogeneity and pastures managed for homogeneity with a linear mixed effect (LME) regression model. We used the LME model to partition variation in vegetation structure to each sampled scale so that a higher proportion of variation at the patch scale among pastures managed for heterogeneity indicates patch contrast. To examine the relationship between vegetation structure and plant community composition, we used constrained ordination to measure variation in functional group composition along the vegetation structure gradient. We used the meta-analytical statistic, Cohen's d, to compare effect sizes for patch contrast and plant functional group composition. 4.Management for heterogeneity increased patch contrast and increased the range of plant functional group composition at three of the five experimental locations. 5.Plant functional group composition varied in proportion to the amount of spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure on pastures managed for heterogeneity. 6.Synthesis and applications. Pyric-herbivory management for heterogeneity created patch contrast in vegetation across a broad range of precipitation and plant community types, provided that fire was the primary driver of grazer site selection. Management for heterogeneity did not universally create patch contrast. Stocking rate and invasive plant species are key regulators of heterogeneity, as they determine the influence of fire on the spatial pattern of fuel, vegetation structure and herbivore patch selection, and therefore also require careful management.

All else being equal, C4 plants tend to be favored over C3 plants in warm humid climates and, conversely, C3 plants tend to be favored over C4 plants in cool climates. Empirical observations supported by a photosynthesis model predict the existence of a climatological crossover temperature above which C4 species have a carbon gain advantage and below which C3 species are favored. Model calculations and analysis of current plant distribution suggest that this pCO2-dependent crossover temperature is approximated by a mean temperature of 22°C for the warmest month at the current pCO2 (35 Pa). In addition to favorable temperatures, C4 plants require sufficient precipitation during the warm growing season. C4 plants which are predominantly graminoids of short stature can be competitively excluded by trees (nearly all C3 plants) - regardless of the photosynthetic superiority of the C4 pathway - in regions otherwise favorable for C4. To construct global maps of the distribution of C4 grasses for current, past and future climate scenarios, we make use of climatological data sets which provide estimates of the mean monthly temperature to classify the globe into areas which should favor C4 photosynthesis during at least 1 month of the year. This area is further screened by excluding areas where precipitation is &lt;25 mm per month during the warm season and by selecting areas classified as grasslands (i.e., excluding areas dominated by woody vegetation) according to a global vegetation map. Using this approach, grasslands of the world are designated as C3, C4, and mixed under current climate and pCO2. Published floristic studies were used to test the accuracy of these predictions in many regions of the world, and agreement with observations was generally good. We then make use of this protocol to examine changes in the global abundance of C4 grasses in the past and the future using plausible estimates for the climates and pCO2. When pCO2 is lowered to pre-industrial levels, C4 grasses expanded their range into large areas now classified as C3 grasslands, especially in North America and Eurasia. During the last glacial maximum (~18 ka BP) when the climate was cooler and pCO2 was about 20 Pa, our analysis predicts substantial expansion of C4 vegetation - particularly in Asia, despite cooler temperatures. Continued use of fossil fuels is expected to result in double the current pCO2 by sometime in the next century, with some associated climate warming. Our analysis predicts a substantial reduction in the area of C4 grasses under these conditions. These reductions from the past and into the future are based on greater stimulation of C3 photosynthetic efficiency by higher pCO2 than inhibition by higher temperatures. The predictions are testable through large-scale controlled growth studies and analysis of stable isotopes and other data from regions where large changes are predicted to have occurred.","Berry, J.A.; Clark, J.S.; Collatz, G.J.","","114",1998,"C4; CO2; Climate change; Grassland; Photosynthesis","","","","","","","","",""

American bison were profoundly modified by the extinction event at the end of the Pleistocene. Plains Bison (Bison bison) became obligate grazers, and, like musk ox, elk, and other large ruminants, became much smaller. During the same time period, mastodon, mammoth, horse, ground sloth, and other non-ruminant herbivores went extinct. The vegetation of the North American continent shifted from a mixed mosaic to homogenous stripes: mixed parklands and woodlands throughout the continent were transformed into the great and treeless prairie, and the mixed parkland/woodlands on the coasts became closed-canopy forests. The key to understanding the changes in bison anatomy and behavior, the non-ruminant extinctions, and the vegetative shift is uncovering the ecological dynamics of the end of the Pleistocene. Two major theories have been proposed to explain the extinction event: Overkill - humans hunted animals to extinction and Climate Change - the end of the Ice Age created ecological stress which caused the extinctions and the changes in the size of bison. Both have problems. A new theory is called for. Second Order Predation hypothesizes that humans reduced carnivore populations below the level that they controlled herbivore populations, resulting in an herbivore boom then bust, destabilizing the ecosystem. During the boom phase, herbivores denuded the environment of vegetation, creating a highly competitive environment - a bottleneck - where animals that could extract the maximum nutrition from their food - ruminants -, and reproduce using the minimum amount of food - smaller animals - were evolutionarily favored, while large non-ruminants went extinct. When a new stability was reached in the Holocene, huge herds of bison (B. bison bison) dominated and maintained the grasslands in the center of the country, and trees re-invaded from mountain refugia,where woodland bison (B. bison athabascae) continued to live in small groups and eat a mixture of grass and browse. This bottleneck in the environment explains why horses, non-ruminants that had gone extinct during the transition, could survive in the new stabile ecosystem. Some scientists postulate that the extinctions can be explained through a combination of the Overkill and Climate Change hypotheses. The Pleistocene Extinction Model (PEM) was designed to test all these hypotheses using the same assumptions. The PEM simulations give surprising results: i) If the model is run with sufficient Climate Change to produce extinctions, Overkill reduces the impact of Climate Change, avoiding extinction. ii) Under the same conditions, Second Order Predation exacerbates the impact of Climate Change, leading to quicker and more extreme extinction. iii) Second Order Predation alone also causes extinction. iv) Simulations that produce extinction create a vegetative shift. This new understanding sheds light on the behavioral and anatomical shifts of bison. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Greyzems are characterized by a dark mollic horizon, with uncoated (bleached) silt and sand grains on pedfaces, and an argic horizon as diagnostic horizons. The FAO-Unesco soil map of the world shows Greyzems and Luvisols in Russia at this transition (the Russian soil map shows only Greyzems), while in similar geographic position in the USA and Canada the proportion of Greyzems is very small and Luvic Phaeozems/Chernozems and Albic Luvisols occupy those transitional zones of the grassland-forest interface. Three Greyzem profiles, presently under forest, and developed on loess-like mantle loams of Late Weichselian (Valday) age in the northern forest-steppe zone of the East European plain (Middle Russian Upland) were described and sampled near Pushchino, some 100 km south of Moscow. Micromorphology, particle size data, chemical data and clay mineralogy were studied. Based on the particle size distribution and the occurrence of fragments of a second humus horizon (SHH) the presence of two, rather similar, deposits in the solum is advocated. The following processes have been deduced from the study: (i) decalcification and secondary accumulation of carbonates; (ii) humus accumulation, including the significance of the SHH; (iii) clay illuviation, presumably two main phases; (iv) biological activity; (v) degradation of the mollic A: occurrence of bleached grains; (vi) downward migration of textural components and organic matter, in the Bt horizon along major pedfaces: occurrence of black organo-clay coatings and uncoated silt/sand grains; (vii) gleying. The tentative sequence of these processes during Late Weichselian and Holocene times leads us to conclude that Greyzems are polygenetic. They formed as Podzo(Luvisols) under forest, with fine clay coatings in the fine pores inside the blocky and prismatic peds, in the Late Glacial and Early Holocene. The change to tall grass steppe in the Atlanticum created a mollic horizon, that degrades when forest re-invades during the Subatlanticum. Fine clay, combined with organic matter forms black coatings on the major pedfaces. Uncoated silt and sand particles also migrate downward along those major pedfaces. Biological activity is involved in the very complex pattern of the transitional AhE and EBt horizons. Active gleying only occurs in the profile on the lowest topographic position. These latter processes are still active today. Similar soils do occur in the grassland-forest interface in North America, except where the younger age of the landscape and high CaCO3 content at shallow depth prevented their full development.","Gerasimova, M.I.; Koulechova, I.N.; Miedema, R.","","34",1999,"Greyzems; Podzoluvisols; Russia; Soil formation","","","","","","","","",""

On additional rotation plots, continuous corn (Zea mays L.) or no-till corn, fallow, wheat, and no-till corn in a 4-year rotation were grown. The Sidney soil was broken from native sod in 1970 and planted to wheat-fallow with no-till, plow-tillage, and sod-plot treatments. Moist soil samples were collected and refrigerated until plant material removal by sieving and picking. The SOC and SMB-C decreased during incubation and rates of loss measured. The results from this study allow insights into contributions of SMB and changes in soil isotope C ratios not previously available. Soil microbial biomass C contributed an average of 31% of the evolved CO2-C across all treatments between day 10 and day 79 of incubation and an average of about 20% during the more extended times between later measurements thereafter. Until day 160, evolution of 13CO2 during incubation indicated that evolved C came from plant residues and was soil derived thereafter, including from the native grassland SOC. Where corn was grown, evolution of evolved C is hypothesized to have had a less negative 13CO2 isotope signature from days 630 to 720 of the incubation because of the delayed microbial breakdown of the cob materials. After 853 days of incubation and across all plots, the SOC remaining averaged 67% and was similar to the amount of observed hydrolysis residue C. Acid hydrolysis and 14C dating were also used to characterize the resistant SOC fraction and showed increased 14C age with hydrolysis but not with long-term incubation.

A more precise knowledge of postglacial tilt history will assist studies of the evolution of the major lakes in Manitoba and will facilitate the engineering and environmental management of the present-day hydrological system. This paper explores the benefits of combining geomorphological data with high-precision, real-time geodetic data (GPS positioning and absolute gravity) and lake-gauge tilt data now being collected for postglacial rebound studies in Manitoba and adjacent regions in the US. Presently-available data sets representing these data types are (1) tilting of the 9.5 kyr B.P. Campbell strand line south and west of Lake Winnipeg, (2) the rate of decrease in absolute gravity values measured from 1987 to 1995 at Churchill, Manitoba, and (3) the present-day regional tilt rate derived from water-level gauges in southern Manitoba lakes. These data are compared to theoretical predictions based on the published ICE-3G loading history and on a model of Earth theology characterized by a 1066B density and elastic structure, an upper-mantle viscosity of 1021 Pa s, a lower-mantle viscosity of 2 x 1021 Pa s, and a lithosphere thickness of 120 km (Tushingham and Peltier, 1991). All three data types show disagreement in Manitoba with ICE-3G and the 'standard' Earth model. ICE-4G does better but could not be investigated in any detail. The constraints on model parameters provided by the different data types were investigated by varying, one at a time, three key parameters, (1) the thickness of the lithosphere in excess of 120 km, (2) the lower mantle viscosity, and (3) the thickness of Laurentide ice over the Prairies, to obtain better fits to the data. The present data do not appear to constrain lithosphere thickness in excess of 120 km very well. While both the Campbell strand line data and the Churchill absolute gravity data are consistent with an increase in lower-mantle viscosity, the present-day, lake-gauge data are not. All three data types are consistent with a thinning of the Laurentide ice-sheet over the Prairies relative to the ICE-3G model. Simultaneous adjustment of model parameters with the advantage of anticipated new data in Manitoba and adjacent regions in the US will lead to better understanding of the trade-offs between Earth theology and ice sheet history and hence to an improved Laurentide postglacial rebound model.","James, T.S.; Lambert, A.; Thorleifson, L.H.","","19",1998,"Absolute gravimetry; Lake Agassiz; Lake Winnipeg; Laurentide ice sheet; Postglacial rebound; Strand line","","","","","","","","",""

The Angostura Formation contains a rich assemblage of foraminifera associated with mollusks (rudists, gastropods), corals, and dasycladacean green algae. A detailed foraminiferal study was carried out on samples from the El Coyol section of the Angostura succession. The studied section crops out in the El Coyol Hacienda located north of the Angostura dam, SE of the city of Tuxtla Gutiérrez in Central Chiapas. The foraminiferal assemblage consists mostly of benthic larger foraminifera but minor pelagic influence is represented by the presence of a number of planktic foraminifera. The benthic foraminiferal association is taxonomically diverse, being composed of Chubbina jamaicensis Robinson, Chubbina macgillavry Robinson, Caribealveolina michaudi Pêcheux, C. fourcadei Vicedo, Caus and Frijia, C. obesa (Fourcade and Fleury), Praechubbina breviclaustra Fourcade and Fleury, Omphalocyclus macroporus (Lamarck), Asterorbis rooki Vaughan and Cole, Vaughanina cubensis (Palmer), V. barkeri, Brönnimann, Sulcoperculina dickersoni (Palmer), S. globosa de Cizancourt, S. vermunti (Thiadens), Lepidorbitoides minima Douvillé, Orbitoides cf.

Previous cement-stratigraphic studies and paleontological finds suggest that calcite mineralization was initiated during Permian time, whereas goethite and other oxides apparently formed from oxidation of preexisting Fe-sulfides during Pleistocene time. Therefore, these deposits have the potential to offer insight into surficial hydrology and paleoen-vironment in an upland setting from two time periods at a single site. δ 13 C PDB and δ 18 O SMOW measurements of 17 samples from growth bands in a single karst-fill calcite crystal range from -10.7%o to -6.6%o (mean = -8.6%o) and 27.1%o to 28.3%o (mean = 28%o), respectively. Large oscillations in the δ 13 C values through the growth series may originate from seasonal changes in the magnitude of biological productivity during Permian time. These δ 13 C oscillations contrast with the relative stability of the δ 18 O values, which are more positive than would be expected for isotopic equilibrium with local modern waters. The δ 18 O values of the calcite may reflect the δ 18 O values of ambient meteoric groundwaters in the Permian that were isotopically similar to waters in modern, seasonally dry, low-latitude coastal regions. Goethites are not in equilibrium with modern waters or coexisting calcites in the fissure-fill deposit as determined from δ 18 O and δD values of the goethites. Furthermore, the combined δ 18 O and δD values of the goethites are indicative of formation from meteoric waters at a temperature of ∼9 °C ± 3 °C. This inferred temperature is 7 °C ± 3 °C cooler than local modern mean annual temperature and corresponds well with independent studies that propose temperatures ∼6 °C cooler in this region during Pleistocene time. The mole fraction and δ 13 C values of the Fe(CO 3 )OH component in solid solution in the goethite sample are 0.0103 and -10.1%o, respectively. In combination, these values suggest that goethite formed in an environment characterized by mixing of three isotopically distinct CO 2 components: (1) oxidized biological carbon, (2) atmospheric CO 2 , and (3) CO 2 from dissolution of carbonate in the karst system. Oxidized biological carbon may have originated either from flora characterized by C3 or mixed C3:C4 photosynthesizers. Mass balance calculations between these three CO 2 end members correspond to an inferred soil CO 2 concentration [CO 2 contributed from (1) and (2) above] ranging from ∼8,000 ppmV to ∼16,000 ppmV for a local ecosystem dominated by C 3 flora. This inferred range of soil CO 2 concentrations is typical of grasslands characterized by relatively high biological productivity. If C4 flora were a significant source of oxidizing carbon, the higher calculated ambient CO 2 concentration at the time of goethite crystallization in the cave (∼20,000 ppmV) might be interpreted to correspond to an unusually productive C4 soil present at a time of generally cooler and drier conditions across the southern Great Plains of North America. © 2005 Geological Society of America.","Tabor, N.J.; Yapp, C.J.","","395",2005,"Hydrogen and carbon isotopes; Oxygen; Paleoclimate; Permian; Pleistocene","","","","","","","","",""

Chemical weathering rates in carbonates are poorly known, and, because large areas are underlain by these rocks, solute fluxes are important to estimating global weathering rates. Grasslands exist where the amount of precipitation is extremely variable, both within and between years, so studies in grasslands must account for changes in weathering that accompany changes in precipitation. This study: (1) identifies phases that dominate chemical fluxes at Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) and Long-Term Ecological Research Site, and (2) addresses the impact of variable precipitation on mineral weathering. The study site is a remnant tallgrass prairie in the central USA, representing baseline weathering in a mid-temperate climate grassland. Groundwater chemistry and hydrology in the 1.2 km2 watershed used for this study suggest close connections between groundwater and surface water. Water levels fluctuate seasonally. High water levels coincide with periods of precipitation plus low evapotranspiration rather than during precipitation peaks during the growing season. Precipitation is concentrated before recharging aquifers, suggesting an as yet unquantified residence time in the thin soils. Groundwater and surface water are oversaturated with respect to calcite within limitations of available data. Water is more dilute in more permeable aquifers, and water from one aquifer (Morrill) is indistinguishable from surface water. Cations other than Ca co-vary with each other, especially Sr and Mg. Potassium and Si co-vary in all aquifers and surface water, and increases in concentrations of these elements are the best indicators of silicate weathering at this study site. Silicate-weathering indices correlate inversely to aquifer hydraulic conductivity. 87Sr/86Sr in water ranges from 0.70838 to 0.70901, and it decreases with increasing Sr concentration and with increasing silicate-weathering index. Carbonate extracted from aquifer materials, shales, soil, and tufa has Sr ranging from about 240 (soil) to 880 ppm (Paleozoic limestone). 87Sr/86Sr ranges from 0.70834 ± 0.00006 (limestone) to 0.70904 ± 0.00019 (soil). In all cases, 87Sr/86Sr of aquifer limestone is lower than 87Sr/86Sr of groundwater, indicating a phase in addition to aquifer carbonate is contributing solutes to water. Aquifer recharge controls weathering: during periods of reduced recharge, increased residence time increases the total amount of all phases dissolved. Mixing analysis using 87Sr/86Sr shows that two end members are sufficient to explain sources of dissolved Sr. It is proposed that the less radiogenic end member is a solution derived from dissolving aquifer material; longer residence time increases its contribution. The more radiogenic end member solution probably results from reaction with soil carbonate or eolian dust. This solution dominates solute flux in all but the least permeable aquifer and demonstrates the importance that land-surface and soil-zone reactions have on groundwater chemistry in a carbonate terrain. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The 2-4 m thick paleosols are characterized by blocky textures, shallow depth calcareous horizons overlying silty bioturbated horizons, calcareous nodules, dense mats of fine (< 1 mm diameter) rhizoliths in the upper 750 mm, 5-10 mm diameter rhizoliths up to 3 m deep, and burrows 2-800 mm in diameter. PCF paleosols likely formed within a shrubland and grassland environment. Ichnofossils include backfilled burrows with chambers and cocoons; simple backfilled burrows; small-diameter boxworks; cylindrical burrow complexes; large, scratch-marked burrow networks; large downward spiraling burrows; large subhorizontal burrows; and gravel-filled tunnels and chambers. These unique PCF ichnofossils include three new ichnogenera and eight new ichnospecies. Ichnofossils attributed to ground beetles, ants, reptiles, and mammals represent a complex variety of behaviors including temporary to permanent dwelling, nesting, and food storing. Rhizoliths and burrows used to interpret media consistency, organic content, soil moisture, and water-table level are tiered from shallow, intermediate, to deep levels within paleosols with respect to physical and biological factors. Separate bioturbated intervals permits the recognition of two different paleosols that otherwise might not have been recognized. Such well-developed paleosols with high densities of terrestrial burrows have substantial sequence stratigraphic significance since they define surfaces of low sedimentation, base level, and accommodation. The PCF ichnofossil assemblages represent at least three distinct ichnocoenoses. The Kladosystemites ichnocoenosis, with Kladosystemites, Polychoredrites, Parowanichnus, and 1-10 mm diameter rhizoliths, is present in the upper profile of well-drained, consolidated, and nutrient-rich paleosols with dense concentrations of small-to-large plants at the surface. The Beaconites ichnocoenosis, with Beaconites, Katarrhedrites, and 5-10 mm rhizoliths, is present in the lower profile of moderately organic paleosols above the influence of the water table but subject to seasonally variable saturated and unsaturated conditions due to precipitation. The Daimonelix ichnocoenosis, with Daimonelix, Beaconites, small-to-large Katarrhedrites, and 5-10 mm diameter rhizoliths, is present in the lower profile of very organic-rich paleosols generally above the influence of the water table but subject to seasonally variable saturated and unsaturated conditions. Integration of data from body fossils, ichnofossils, paleosols, and sedimentary environments provides new insight into Neogene ecosystems. Paleosol properties combined with the ichnofossil distribution, abundance, and diversity indicates that Miocene PCF paleosols formed under a seasonal climate subject to wide variation in temperature and precipitation. The diverse assemblage of burrow morphologies records adaptation of the local fauna to these environmental conditions. The response of soil ecosystems to short- and long-term changes in climate is, therefore, vital to any study of the effects of climate change in the geologic record. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Grasslands occur on every continent except Antarctica, are ecologically and economically important, and provide critical ecosystem goods and services at local, regional, and global scales. Grasslands are surprisingly diverse and difficult to define. Although grasses and other grasslike plants are the dominant vegetation in all grasslands, grasslands also include a diverse assemblage of other plant life forms that contribute to their species richness and diversity. Many grasslands also support a diverse animal community, including some of the most species-rich grazing food webs on the planet. Grasslands allocate a large proportion of their biomass below ground, resulting in large root to shoot ratios. This pattern of biomass allocation coupled with slow decomposition and weathering rates leads to significant accumulations of soil organic matter and often highly fertile soils. Climate, fire, and grazing are three important drivers that affect the composition, structure, and functioning of grasslands. In addition to the independent effects of these factors, there are many interactions among grazing, fire, and climate that affect ecological patterns and processes in grasslands in ways that may differ from the independent effects of each driver alone. Grasslands occur under a broad range of climatic conditions, though water is generally limiting for some part of the year in most grasslands. Many grasslands experience periodic droughts and a dormant season based on seasonal dry or cold conditions. Grasslands are sensitive to climate variability and climate changes. There are well-documented shifts in the distribution of North American grasslands in response to past droughts, and both observational data and experiments suggest that grasslands will be affected by future changes in rainfall and temperature. Fire is a common occurrence, particularly in more mesic grasslands, due to the large accumulations of dry, highly combustible fine fuel in the form of dead plant material. Fire affects virtually all ecological processes in grasslands, from the physiology of individual plants to the landscape-level patterns, though the effects of fire vary with grassland productivity and the accumulation of detritus. All grasslands are grazed or have experienced grazing as a selective force at some point in their evolutionary history. The ecological effects of grazing vary with climate and plant productivity, and the associated evolutionary history of grazers in different grasslands. Grasslands have been heavily exploited by humans, and many temperate grasslands are now among the most threatened ecosystems globally. Widespread cultivation of grasslands was the major land-use change that impacted grasslands historically, while multiple global changes drivers (i.e., altered fire and grazing regimes, woody plant encroachment, elevated CO2, invasive species, fragmentation) contribute to the contemporary loss of grasslands. Grassland restoration aims to recover the diversity and ecosystem services that grasslands provide. While restored grasslands may attain productivity comparable to native grasslands and sequester carbon for extended periods, they typically support much less diversity than comparable native grasslands. Recovery of soil communities and properties is often very slow. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","Blair, J.; Briggs, J.; Nippert, J.","","",2014,"","","","","","","","","",""

Some suggest that sequestration rates could be large enough to account for some of the missing sink in the global CO2 budget, but further data on soil charcoal pools are necessary to adequately develop boreal carbon budgets under a changing climate and fire regime. The primary objective of this study was to determine the amount of charred wood in surface mineral soil horizons (Ah) of the Boreal Transition of Saskatchewan, a fire-prone grassland forest ecotone region of western Canada. A second objective was to use the charcoal data to infer vegetation dynamics and the development of these Ah horizons as a function of parent material type, i.e. glacio-fluvial, glacio-lacustrine and glacial till. The latter objective served to provide information in regards to future vegetation shifts and ecosystem C budgets of Boreal Plain ecosystems under climatic warming. The carbon fraction measured as charcoal is an important component of organic matter in Ah horizons of Chernozemic soils in Saskatchewan and differs from the classical model of humus fractions in Chernozems which suggests that it is a system created from microbial degradation of root litter only. The carbon sequestered as charcoal within the whole ecoregion was estimated at 36.1 Tg, which is the lower limit of the global annual rate of charcoal accumulation in terrestrial environments estimated from experimental fires. Charcoal pools were consistently lower in the fluvial soils relative to the lacustrine and till soils. We suggest a model where dry conditions and low water availability prevailing under the coarser fluvial soils during the Holocene favoured the dominance of low productivity herbaceous vegetation that led to a high ash to charcoal production ratio from fire and to the development of relatively thick Ah horizons through below ground additions of organic matter from root decay. We propose that the more available water in lacustrine and till soils favoured the growth of trembling aspen which, through less frequent/intense fires relative to grasslands and incomplete burning of the woody material, led to high charcoal accumulation rates in soil. The development of thick Ah horizons in lacustrine soils likely occurred during a warm and dry period of the early Holocene (i.e. the hypsithermal) when herbaceous vegetation invaded forested land or during dry spells in the mid to late Holocene (e.g. the Medieval Warm Period) when opening of forest canopies occurred, thus augmenting light transmission to the forest floor and favouring the growth of herbaceous vegetation in the understory. Such events did not create deep Ah horizons in the tills soils as a consistent rock impediment near the surface limited the penetration of understory roots at greater depth. These results suggest that fluvial sites my be the first shifting to herbaceous vegetation in the future due to climatic warming, followed by till sites and then lacustrine sites. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The fissures are in gypsum of the Jurassic Todilto Formation. Structural analysis suggests the fissures opened to the surface during the Pleistocene in response to extension associated with the Rio Grande rift. Bones were found approximately 9-12 m (30-40 ft) below the modern land surface in three different fissures within approximately a 15-m (∼50-ft) radius. Four species of large mammals are preserved in the fissures, each known from at least one partial to nearly complete skeleton: stilt-legged horse (Equus cf. E. francisci), camel (Camelops hesternus), extinct bison (Bison antiquus), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). The most fossiliferous fissure, containing one skeleton each of a camel and a bison, was 18 cm (7 in) wide and contained bones over a depth of approximately 40-50 cm (15-20 in) and a length of approximately 3.5-4 m (11-13 ft). The camel consists of a partial skeleton of a very old individual of Camelops hesternus with heavily worn teeth and evidence of osteoarthritis on the articular surfaces of several limb bones and toes. The bison is a nearly complete articulated skeleton of a juvenile Bison antiquus with deciduous premolars, unerupted third molars, and unfused epiphyses on all limb bones. A second nearby fissure contained an articulated front limb of an advanced juvenile or young adult Equus cf. E. francisci and an articulated hind limb of a second adult Camelops hesternus. A third fissure had a nearly complete skeleton of a young adult female Odocoileus hemionus. The White Mesa mine differs from most New Mexico Pleistocene cave faunas in the predominance of articulated skeletons and the rarity of small vertebrates, although a partial skeleton of the pocket gopher Thomomys talpoides was found in the same fissure that produced the deer skeleton. An AMS radiocarbon date on a Camelops metacarpal from the White Mesa mine yielded an age of 12,910 ± 60 14C yrs B.P. The predominance of grazing ungulates in the fissures, including horse, camel, and bison, suggests that the habitat in the vicinity during the late Pleistocene consisted of a grassland. The following is a hypothetical sequence of events that led to the preservation of partial to nearly complete skeletons of large Pleistocene mammals in very narrow fissures that were not wide enough to accommodate the living (or recently dead) animals. The fissures were open to the surface in the late Pleistocene and acted as natural traps into which the animals inadvertently fell. The fissures were wider near the surface and narrower at depth. The animals either died from falling into the fissures or were unable to climb out and starved to death. The articulated condition of the skeletons and the lack of bite marks on the bones suggest the fissures were inaccessible to predators or scavengers that would have damaged and disassociated the carcasses. The bodies of the ungulates began to decompose in the wider portion of the fissures nearer the surface. Finally, the mostly decomposed skeletons still held together by connective tissues fell and became lodged in the lower and narrower portion of the fissures where they were eventually discovered.","Morgan, G.S.; Rinehart, L.F.","","29",2007,"","","","","","","","","",""

However, mounting evidence suggests phytochemical-induced germination inhibition can be an adaptive response to competitive conditions, not the consequence of toxin exposure. That is, selective advantages can exist for seeds to chemically recognize potential competitor presence and defer germination until better establishment conditions occur. This Biochemical Recognition Hypothesis (BRH) contrasts the allelopathy paradigm by predicting greater germination inhibition following phytochemical exposure of sympatric compared to allopatric species. In a glasshouse, we grew 12 species native to Argentinean and North American grasslands and tested whether phytochemical leachates from co-occurring species reduced seedling emergence more than those having no historic association. Two species had 13% and 27% emergence reductions following leachate exposure of sympatric relative to allopatric species, supporting species-specific BR. Intraspecific leachates reduced emergence more than those from heterospecifics, suggesting within-species BR may be common. Only the four smallest seeded species exhibited heterospecific BR responses, suggesting that selection for assessing local competition potential may intensify as seed reserves decline. Importantly, leachate origin did not affect seedling biomass nor accelerate germination, indicating a non-toxic biochemical effect on germination reduction but not growth. Synthesis. Coupling ample theoretical support with empirical evidence here and elsewhere, an 'eavesdrop-and-wait' competition avoidance strategy could be a common phenomenon. Our findings suggest sympatric association may contribute to evolution of species-specific BR and that seed traits are important in its development. The underlying mechanism affecting these germination decisions may be simple phytochemical-induced hormonal regulation. Factors preclude BR from being ubiquitous but nonetheless, BR provides a potentially powerful mechanism by which some plant populations and the spatiotemporal diversity of some communities are structured. Lastly, allelopathy may be erroneously invoked when phytochemical-induced germination reduction occurs but a toxicity mechanism has not been elucidated. In many cases, this fits more with the BRH than classic allelopathy.

We supported this hypothesis in a study of the geographic variation in the interactions among Eurosta solidaginis and its natural enemies. Eurosta solidaginis is a fly (Diptera: Tephritidae) that induces galls on subspecies of tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima altissima and S. a. gilvocanescens. We measured selection on E. solidaginis gall size and shape in the prairie and forest biomes in Minnesota and North Dakota over an 11-year period. Galls were larger and more spherical in the prairie than in the forest. We supported the hypothesis that the divergence in gall morphology in the two biomes is due to different selection regimes exerted by natural enemies of E. solidaginis. Each natural enemy exerted similar selection on gall diameter in both biomes, but differences in the frequency of natural enemy attack created strong differences in overall selection between the prairie and forest. Bird predation increased with gall diameter, creating selection for smaller-diameter galls. A parasitic wasp, Eurytoma gigantea, and Mordellistena convicta, an inquiline beetle, both caused higher E. solidaginis mortality in smaller galls, exerting selection for increased gall diameter. In the forest there was stabilizing selection on gall diameter due to a combination of bird predation on larvae in large galls, and M. convicta- and E. gigantea-induced mortality on larvae in small galls. In the prairie there was directional selection for larger galls due to M. convicta and E. gigantea mortality on larvae in small galls. Mordellistena convicta-induced mortality was consistently higher in the prairie than in the forest, whereas there was no significant difference in E. gigantea-induced mortality between biomes. Bird predation was nonexistent in the prairie so the selection against large galls found in the forest was absent. We supported the hypothesis that natural enemies of E. solidaginis exerted selection for spherical galls in both biomes. In the prairie M. convicta exerts stabilizing selection to maintain spherical galls. In the forest there was directional selection for more spherical galls. Eurytoma gigantea exerted selection on gall shape in the forest in a complex manner that varied among years. We also supported the hypothesis that E. gigantea is coevolving with E. solidaginis. The parasitoid had significantly longer ovipositors in the prairie than in the forest, indicating the possibility that it has evolved in response to selection to reach larvae in the larger-diameter prairie galls. © 2007 The Author(s).","Craig, T.P.; Horner, J.D.; Itami, J.K.","","61",2007,"Coevolution; Eurosta solidaginis; Geographic mosaic of coevolution; Geographic races; Indirect interaction; Solidago altissima; Tritrophic interaction","","","","","","","","",""

Of three proposed colonization routes to North America from Asia, the Dene used the middle route, both geographically and temporally, crossing Alaska and the Yukon 6000 years ago. As their greatest linguistic divergence is in Alaska, linguists are able to estimate the times and places of their movement south, even as far as the American Southwest. Unlike their dialects, their toolkits are quite generalized: bifacial knives, scrapers, wedges, hammerstones, pushplanes and chithos, with projectile points being the most diagnostic tool for differentiating phases. As points abruptly changed from darts to arrows in the southwest Yukon, some archaeologists retain the belief that this and contemporaneous volcanic eruption and White River ash deposition 1200 years ago started a Dene exodus south or east and that this entailed a population-displacing domino effect all the way to the American Southwest, where they formed the Navajo-Apache, but this is fanciful. The earlier movement east on the middle route followed the Yukon River to its headwaters, then south and east to the Peace River and Lake Athabaska to reach the Barrenlands 2600 years ago. This delay was due partly to Inuit-like Pre-Dorset occupying the northern forest before climatic warming influenced their return north to the sea. Since that time, the Dene have followed the annual movements of the Beverly caribou herd. Linguistics and the present locations of the Subarctic Dene help trace past movement: Gwich'in in northern Yukon, Hän and Tutchone in central and southern Yukon, Tahltan-Kaska-Tsetsaut in northern British Columbia; Sekani-Beaver, Carrier, Chilcotin and Nicola in its Central Plateau, Chipewyan-Slavey-Yellowknife in the northern Prairie Provinces and Northwest Territories; Dogrib-Bear Lake, Mountain or Nahanni and Hare in the northern Mackenzie District; Sarsi in southern Alberta, and Navaho and Apache in the American Southwest. Three routes were also postulated for movement to the Southwest, the Plains route being the first to be suggested and, in my opinion, the most logical. I suggest the Navaho and Apache arose from the Chipewyan 800-1200 years ago, when some north Saskatchewan Chipewyan changed from hunting migratory caribou to migratory bison, adapting fully to a Plains existence, and taking the Chipewyan south under the spoke-and-rim migrations of the bison. To prove this, one must ignore 5-pole hogans, triangular arrowheads and early pottery because the Chipewyan were preceramic. We must find pre-1400 AD side-notched arrowheads, brush shelters or tipis, arrowshaft smoothers, hide abraders, bone fleshers and beamers, large retouched flakes and knives, plus signs of dog transport and the horizontal-release sinew-backed double-curved bow. From northern British Columbia the Dene also spread south to the Oregon and California coasts to form the Pacific Dene about 1500 years ago. Pacific and Arctic drainage Dene are very different yet their language, social structure and toolkits are similar, the latter copied heavily from cultures where they reside. This has presented immense challenges to archaeologists. Due to widespread movement and ready adaptation to many environments, the Dene have the largest distribution of all New World people, although their numbers are small. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

On the basis of detailed stratigraphic studies in Michigan and in context with modern sequence stratigraphic concepts, we can now demonstrate more conclusively interregional correlations with the adjacent Illinois basin and Wisconsin arch and interpret regional geologic history. The Lower through Middle Ordovician succession in the central Michigan basin contains nearly 1,000 m (3,000 ft) of heterolithic carbonate, siliciclastic, and evaporitic strata. Peritidal carbonate strata assigned to the informal Brazos interval of the upper Prairie du Chien Group (PdC) are as young as lowermost Middle Ordovician (earliest Whiterockian stage) in the central Michigan basin. Within the resolution of the current biostratigraphic framework, the uppermost PdC succession appears to be conformable with overlying strata within the central basin. Strata coeval with the Brazos interval are absent on the basin margins where the Shakopee Dolomite underlies the sequence-bounding, sub-Tippecanoe surface, which is an unconformity in these locations. This unconformity is apparently absent in the central basin due to basin subsidence concomitant with uppermost-Lower to Middle Ordovician (post-Sauk) emergence in the adjacent cratonic interior. Throughout the Michigan basin the St. Peter Sandstone overlies the sub-Tippecanoe surface and ranges in thickness from essentially 0 to more than 366 m (1,200 ft) in the basin center. The St. Peter is interpreted as shallow marine paralic and shelf strata deposited during initial Tippecanoe transgression across the cratonic interior. Transitional lithofacies at the top of the St. Peter in the central Michigan basin document a change to generally clastics-starved deposition during Glenwood Formation time associated with continued and widespread submergence of the craton. These strata were deposited, in part, in a marine, storm-dominated shelf environment relatively distal with respect to clastic sediment input. Highly variable lithofacies in the Glenwood suggest complex paleogeography in the Michigan basin at this time. Faunal and complex lithofacies relations in the Glenwood Formation indicate periods of restricted marine circulation and possible dysoxia, probably due to localized, intraformational regression. Comparison of lithofacies and preliminary biostratigraphic data in the upper midwest, including the Michigan basin, indicates that the well-known St. Peter Sandstone is time transgressive from the central Michigan and Illinois basins to the outcrop area on the Wisconsin arch, and that the central Michigan basin contains one of the most complete Lower to Middle Ordovician successions in the cratonic interior of North America. Relatively slow (compared to active continental margins) but persistent basin subsidence of less than 30 m/m.y. was apparently sufficient to maintain accommodation space and continuous deposition of these Ordovician strata in the central Michigan basin despite regional relative sea level trends. The stratigraphic relations and correlations presented here are consistent with a sequence stratigraphic interpretation in which subtle interplay between basin subsidence and eustatic sea level fluctuations in the stable cratonic interior dominate regional stratigraphy.","Barnes, D.A.; Harrison III, W.B.; Shaw, T.H.","","306",1996,"","","","","","","","","",""

Floodplains are an important component of watershed systems because they affect downstream storage and delivery of overbank flood waters, and they also serve as sources and temporary sinks for sediments and toxic substances delivered by river systems. Here, 14C and 137Cs isotopic dating methods are used along with ages of culturally related phenomena associated with mining and agriculture to determine rates of sedimentation and morphologic change for a reach of the upper Mississippi River and adjacent tributaries in southwestern Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois. The most important environmental change that influenced fluvial activity in this region during last 10,000 years involved the conversion of a late Holocene mosaic of prairie and forest to a landscape dominated by cropland and pastureland associated with Euro-American settlement. Results presented herein for the Upper Mississippi Valley (UMV) show that the shift from pre-agriculture, natural land cover to landscape dominance by agricultural land use of the last 175-200 years typically increased rates and magnitudes of floodplain sedimentation by at least an order of magnitude. Accelerated overbank flooding led to increased bank heights on tributary streams and, in turn, contributed to more frequent deep flows of high energy. These high energy flows subsequently promoted bank erosion and lateral channel migration, and the formation of a historical meander belt whose alluvial surface constitutes a new historical floodplain inset against the earlier historical floodplain. The new historical floodplain serves as a ""flume-like"" channel that provides efficient downstream transport of water and sediment associated with moderate and large magnitude floods. Floodplains on lower tributaries, however, continue to experience rates of overbank sedimentation that are of anomalously high magnitude given improved land cover and land conservation since about 1950. This lower valley anomaly is explained by minimal development of historical (agriculture period) meander belts because of relatively low stream power in these channel and floodplain reaches of relatively low gradient. In general, long-term pre-agriculture rates of vertical accretion between about 10,000 and 200 years ago averaged about 0.2 mm yr- 1 in tributary watersheds smaller than about 700 km2 and about 0.9 mm yr- 1 on the floodplain of the upper Mississippi River where the contributing watershed area increases to about 170,000 km2. On the other hand, rates of historical vertical accretion during the period of agricultural dominance of the last 200 years average between 2 and 20 mm yr- 1, with short episodes of even higher rates during times of particularly poor land conservation practices. Significant hydrologic effects of mining and agricultural started by the 1820s and became widespread in the study region by the mid-19th century. The hydrologic and geomorphic influences of mining were relatively minor compared to those related to agriculture. High resolution dating of floodplain vertical accretion deposits shows that large floods have frequently provided major increments of sedimentation on floodplains of tributaries and the main valley upper Mississippi River. The relative importance of large floods as contributors to floodplain vertical accretion is noteworthy because global atmospheric circulation models indicate that the main channel upper Mississippi River should experience increased frequencies of extreme hydrologic events, including large floods, with anticipated continued global warming. Instrumental and stratigraphic records show that, coincident with global warming, a shift to more frequent large floods occurred since 1950 on the upper Mississippi River, and these floods generally contributed high magnitudes of floodplain sedimentation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Each province, linked to a discrete source region, represents Pleistocene fluvial channel belts within which depositional activity was controlled by periods of climate, sediment supply, and sea level changes. Four coasta l heavy mineral provinces have been identified. The Northern Province (NP), drained by the lower reaches of the Sabine and Calcasieu Rivers underlies level mid- and late Pleistocene coastal terrace surfaces and is distinguished by high-grade metamorphic assemblages (kyanite, staurolite, sillimanite) and abundant zircon, probably of Ouachita Mts. derivation. Transporting eroded Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Pleistocene coastal plain deposits, the modern Calcasieu and Sabine River sands in west-central and southwest Louisiana and east Texas, display identical heavy mineral composition to that of the NP. Level Late Pleistocene coastal terrace areas in the east represent the Red River Province (RRP) with dominant epidote, tourmaline, garnet, and zircon. Its mineralogy is influenced significantly by Paleozoic-Mesozoic sedimentary units that frame the drainage basin upstream. Modern Red River sands differ in their spectra both from Red River Pleistocene coastal terrace and valley terrace deposits, interpreted by temporal fluctuations in sediment supply initiating a variable contribution of detritus from different sources. Tributaries that drain formations with high concentrations of high-grade metamorphic minerals also affected Red River valley Pleistocene terrace deposits in west-central Louisiana, enriching them in kyanite and staurolite. The Mississippi Province (MP) occupies the eastern-southeastern area of the low, flat, gently seaward-sloping Prairie coastal terrace. Whereas modern Mississippi alluvium is dominated by hornblende, pyroxenes, and epidote, as the result of post-depositional dissolution, pyroxenes are rare in the MP. The Mixed Suite Province (MSP) reflects MP, RRP, and to a lesser degree, NP signatures and forms the Prairie fluvial coastal plain surface closer to the Texas state line. Raw data of the principal heavy minerals were used for statistical analysis. Statistical parameters proved consistent with mineralogy-derived reconstruction of sediment provenance and provinciality of heavy mineral suites, thus providing an independent and objective support to data interpretation. Optical and thermal luminescence dating at other Gulf locations [Otvos, E.G. (2005). Numerical chronology of Pleistocene coastal plain and valley development; extensive aggradation during glacial low sea levels. Quaternary Internat., 135 91-113.] supports the pre-Sangamon ages of the Intermediate Pleistocene terraces in the NP area. Sangamon (135-116 ka), Eowisconsin (114-76 ka), and Wisconsin (74-36 ka) dates characterize the four provinces in the low, level northern Gulf Prairie coastal plain. Refuting earlier assumptions that coastal plain aggradation occurred only during marine highstand phases, thermal and optical luminescence dates indicated that, despite the low Eowisconsin and Wisconsin eustatic sea levels of several preglacial and glacial stages and substages, coastal plain alluviation, paradoxically, recurred between 106 and 35 ka BP. An interesting outcome of our heavy mineral study is the recognition and dating of a previously undocumented, rare ash-fall event that originated in Caribbean andesitic volcanoes. It was identified by the presence of a volcanogenic heavy mineral suite, composed of pristine euhedral clinopyroxene, sphene, zircon, apatite, and hexagonal biotite. Unaffected by fluvial reworking, this suite was recovered from a MP sample, dated ca. 86 ka BP. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon isotope ratios of tooth enamel, soil carbonate, carbonate cements, and plant lipids indicate a late Miocene-Pliocene (8-2 Ma) transition from C3 vegetation to dominantly C4 grasses at many sites around the world. However, these isotopic proxies cannot identify whether the C4 grasses replaced woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) or C3 grasses. Here we propose a method for reconstructing the carbon isotope ratio of Neogene grasses using the carbon isotope ratio of organic matter trapped in plant silica bodies (phytoliths). Although a wide range of plants produce phytoliths, we hypothesize that in grass-dominated ecosystems the majority of phytoliths will be derived from grasses, and will yield a grass carbon isotope signature. Phytolith extracts can be contaminated by non-phytolith silica (e.g., volcanic ash). To test the feasibility of the method given these potential problems, we examined sample purity (phytolith versus non-phytolith silica), abundance of grass versus non-grass phytoliths, and carbon isotope ratios of phytolith extracts from late Miocene-Pliocene paleosols of the central Great Plains. Isotope results from the purest samples are compared with phytolith assemblage analysis of these same extracts. The dual record spans the interval of focus (ca. 12-2 Ma), allowing us, for the first time, to investigate how isotopic shifts correlate with floral change. We found that many samples contained high abundances of non-biogenic silica; therefore, only a small subset of ""pure"" samples (&gt;50% of phytoliths by volume) with good preservation were considered to provide reliable carbon isotope ratios. All phytolith assemblages contained high proportions (on average 85%) of grass phytoliths, supporting our hypothesis for grass-dominated communities. Therefore, the carbon isotope ratio of pure, well-preserved samples that are dominated by grass biosilica is considered a reliable measure of the proportion of C3 and C4 grasses in the Neogene. The carbon isotope ratios of the pure fossil phytolith samples indicate a transition from predominantly C3 grasses to mixed C 3-C4 grasses by 5.5 Ma and then a shift to more than 80% C4 grasses by 3-2 Ma. With the exception of the Pliocene sample, these isotopic data are broadly concordant with phytolith assemblages that show a general increase in C4 grasses in the late Miocene. However, phytolith assemblage analysis indicates lower relative abundance of C 4 grasses in overall vegetation than do the carbon isotopes from the same phytolith assemblages. The discrepancy may relate to either (1) incomplete identification of (C4) PACMAD phytoliths, (2) higher production of non-diagnostic phytoliths in C4 grasses compared to C3 grasses, or (3) biases in the isotope record toward grasses rather than overall vegetation. The impact of potential incomplete characterization of (C 4) PACMAD phytoliths on assemblage estimates of proportion of C 4, though important, cannot reconcile discrepancies between the methods. We explore hypothesis (2) by analyzing a previously published data set of silica content in grasses and a small data set of modern grass leaf assemblage composition using analysis of variance, independent contrasts, and sign tests. These tests suggest that C4 grasses do not have more silica than C3 grasses; there is also no difference with regard to production of non-diagnostic phytoliths. Thus, it is most likely that the discrepancy between phytolith assemblages and isotope ratios is a consequence of hypothesis (3), that the isotope signature is influenced by the contribution of non-diagnostic grass phytoliths, whereas the assemblage composition is not. Assemblage-based estimates of % C4 within grasses, rather than overall vegetation, are in considerably better agreement with the isotope-based estimates. These results support the idea that, in grass-dominated assemblages, the phytolith carbon isotope method predominantly records shifts in dominant photosynthetic pathways among grasses, whereas phytolith assemblage analysis detects changes in overall vegetation. Carbon isotope ratios of fossil phytoliths in conjunction with phytolith assemblage analysis suggest that the late Neogene expansion of C4 grasses was largely at the expense of C3 grasses rather than C3 shrubs/trees. Stable isotopic analysis of phytoliths can therefore provide unique information about grass community changes during the Neogene, as well as help test how grass phytolith morphology relates to photosynthetic pathway. © 2011 The Paleontological Society.

1844510,"not_duplicate","excluded","not_screened","not_started","database","scopus","","Roots and climate: assessing their role with model simulations","In the terrestrial biosphere the depth of a root system determines how much water can be extracted from the soil and recycled back into the atmosphere. Only recently it was discovered that evergreen forests in Amazonia develop deep roots of up to 18m and that the water uptake from these deep soil layers contribute significantly to dry season transpiration at some sites in Amazonia. With the use of satellite images, it has in fact been estimated that large parts of the evergreen forests in Amazonia depend on deep roots, that is, rooting depths of more than one meter, in order to maintain green canopies during the dry season. However, global models of the terrestrial biosphere and the general atmospheric circulation (GCMs) commonly use prescribed values for rooting depth which are typically of the order of one meter, and generally not exceeding 2 meters. Considering that only sparse observations of rooting depth are available and that these do not necessarily reflect solely the adaptance to water needs (as are, however, only considered within these types of models), we ask how a global distribution of rooting depth can be obtained for such models. The aim of this thesis is to establish a methodology, based on an ecological principle and use it to obtain a global rooting depth distribution and investigate the role of roots in terms of water uptake in the global climate system. The method is based on the idea that the vegetation has adapted to its environment in such a way that it's benefit or fitness is at a maximum. To implement this method, the fitness is measured by the long term mean of the vegetation's productivity, which is simulated by a simple vegetation model. This model computes productivity and soil moisture evolution from atmospheric quantities. It needs rooting depth as a fixed parameter to determine how much plant available water can be stored in the soil. Rooting depth is then obtained by maximising the mean annual productivity in respect to rooting depth. This method is employed on a global scale to obtain a distribution of rooting depth using a global climatology. We find that deep rooted vegetation is predicted in many parts of the tropics. By increasing the storage capacity of plant available soil water, deep roots considerably enhance water availability during the dry season and hence transpiration and productivity. We assess the reasonability of the outcome by different means. A direct comparison to biome averages of observed rooting depths shows that the overall pattern is reproduced fairly well. The reduced annual discharge of large river basins resulting from the increase of basin transpiration complies better to observations. We also find that the optimisation process is primarily driven by the water deficit/surplus during the dry/wet season for humid and arid regions, respectively. The climatic consequences of the presence of deep rooted vegetation is investigated by applying the same method to an atmospheric general circulation model. Here, it is necessary to incorporate the parameterisation of vegetation productivity into the climate model. Again, a considerable increase in the dry-season transpiration is found along with an enhanced latent heat flux. Consequently, mean monthly near-surface air temperatures during the dry season are lower by up to 8° Celsuisu and are found to be in much better agreement to observations. We also isolate a general mechanism by which the enhanced dry-season transpiration leads to an overall intensification of the tropical circulation patterns. Because of the increase of transpiration in the dry-season hemisphere, moister air is carried to the main convection areas in the lower atmosphere. The release of more latent energy leads to increased convection which in turn enhances the overall circulation. Lastly, we assess how much of the climatic changes associated with Amazonian deforestation can be attributed to the removal of deep roots alone. This is done by conducting a series of sensitivity simulations with the climate model, in which some surface characteristics (mainly rooting depth and albedo) are subsequently modified from tropical evergreen forest values to ones representing grassland. The overall response is dominated by the reduction in rooting depth. Significant remote impacts, for instance, a warming over North America and drier conditions over Southeast Asia are also found. This can be attributed to the weakening of the tropical circulation patterns resulting from the reduction in dry season evapotranspiration.","Kleidon, A.","","",1998,"","","","","","","","","",""

The annual global average carbon dioxide concentration at Earth's surface for 2017 was 405.0 ± 0.1 ppm, 2.2 ppm greater than for 2016 and the highest in the modern atmospheric measurement record and in ice core records dating back as far as 800 000 years. The global growth rate of CO2 has nearly quadrupled since the early 1960s. With ENSO-neutral conditions present in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean during most of the year and weak La Niña conditions notable at the start and end, the global temperature across land and ocean surfaces ranked as the second or third highest, depending on the dataset, since records began in the mid-to-late 1800s. Notably, it was the warmest non-El Niño year in the instrumental record. Above Earth's surface, the annual lower tropospheric temperature was also either second or third highest according to all datasets analyzed. The lower stratospheric temperature was about 0.2°C higher than the record cold temperature of 2016 according to most of the in situ and satellite datasets. Several countries, including Argentina, Uruguay, Spain, and Bulgaria, reported record high annual temperatures. Mexico broke its annual record for the fourth consecutive year. On 27 January, the temperature reached 43.4°C at Puerto Madryn, Argentina-the highest temperature recorded so far south (43°S) anywhere in the world. On 28 May in Turbat, western Pakistan, the high of 53.5°C tied Pakistan's all-time highest temperature and became the world-record highest temperature for May. In the Arctic, the 2017 land surface temperature was 1.6°C above the 1981-2010 average, the second highest since the record began in 1900, behind only 2016. The five highest annual Arctic temperatures have all occurred since 2007. Exceptionally high temperatures were observed in the permafrost across the Arctic, with record values reported in much of Alaska and northwestern Canada. In August, high sea surface temperature (SST) records were broken for the Chukchi Sea, with some regions as warm as +11°C, or 3° to 4°C warmer than the longterm mean (1982-present). According to paleoclimate studies, today's abnormally warm Arctic air and SSTs have not been observed in the last 2000 years. The increasing temperatures have led to decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and thickness. On 7 March, sea ice extent at the end of the growth season saw its lowest maximum in the 37-year satellite record, covering 8% less area than the 1981-2010 average. The Arctic sea ice minimum on 13 September was the eighth lowest on record and covered 25% less area than the long-term mean. Preliminary data indicate that glaciers across the world lost mass for the 38th consecutive year on record; the declines are remarkably consistent from region to region. Cumulatively since 1980, this loss is equivalent to slicing 22 meters off the top of the average glacier. Antarctic sea ice extent remained below average for all of 2017, with record lows during the first four months. Over the continent, the austral summer seasonal melt extent and melt index were the second highest since 2005, mostly due to strong positive anomalies of air temperature over most of the West Antarctic coast. In contrast, the East Antarctic Plateau saw record low mean temperatures in March. The year was also distinguished by the second smallest Antarctic ozone hole observed since 1988. Across the global oceans, the overall long-term SST warming trend remained strong. Although SST cooled slightly from 2016 to 2017, the last three years produced the three highest annual values observed; these high anomalies have been associated with widespread coral bleaching. The most recent global coral bleaching lasted three full years, June 2014 to May 2017, and was the longest, most widespread, and almost certainly most destructive such event on record. Global integrals of 0-700-m and 0-2000-m ocean heat content reached record highs in 2017, and global mean sea level during the year became the highest annual average in the 25-year satellite altimetry record, rising to 77 mm above the 1993 average. In the tropics, 2017 saw 85 named tropical storms, slightly above the 1981-2010 average of 82. The North Atlantic basin was the only basin that featured an above-normal season, its seventh most active in the 164-year record. Three hurricanes in the basin were especially notable. Harvey produced record rainfall totals in areas of Texas and Louisiana, including a storm total of 1538.7 mm near Beaumont, Texas, which far exceeds the previous known U.S. tropical cyclone record of 1320.8 mm. Irma was the strongest tropical cyclone globally in 2017 and the strongest Atlantic hurricane outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean on record with maximum winds of 295 km h-1. Maria caused catastrophic destruction across the Caribbean Islands, including devastating wind damage and flooding across Puerto Rico. Elsewhere, the western North Pacific, South Indian, and Australian basins were all particularly quiet. Precipitation over global land areas in 2017 was clearly above the long-term average. Among noteworthy regional precipitation records in 2017, Russia reported its second wettest year on record (after 2013) and Norway experienced its sixth wettest year since records began in 1900. Across India, heavy rain and flood-related incidents during the monsoon season claimed around 800 lives. In August and September, above-normal precipitation triggered the most devastating floods in more than a decade in the Venezuelan states of Bolívar and Delta Amacuro. In Nigeria, heavy rain during August and September caused the Niger and Benue Rivers to overflow, bringing floods that displaced more than 100 000 people. Global fire activity was the lowest since at least 2003; however, high activity occurred in parts of North America, South America, and Europe, with an unusually long season in Spain and Portugal, which had their second and third driest years on record, respectively. Devastating fires impacted British Columbia, destroying 1.2 million hectares of timber, bush, and grassland, due in part to the region's driest summer on record. In the United States, an extreme western wildfire season burned over 4 million hectares; the total costs of $18 billion tripled the previous U.S. annual wildfire cost record set in 1991.","Abernethy, R.;

The White River Badlands (WRB) dunes are located approximately 60 km north of the Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH), in the western section of the northern Great Plains. Clifftop dunes, sand sheets, and stabilized northwest-southeast trending parabolic dunes are found on upland mesas and buttes, locally called tables. The result of this study is a dune stabilization history determined from samples collected from stratigraphic exposures and dune crests. Thirty-seven OSL ages, from this and previous investigations, show three periods of dune activity: 1) ∼21,000 years ago to 12,000 years ago (a), 2) ∼9 to 6 ka, and 3) post-700 a. Stratigraphic exposures and low-relief dune forms preserve evidence of late Pleistocene and middle Holocene dune development, while high-relief dune crests preserve evidence of late Holocene dune development. Results of 12 OSL ages from the most recent dune activation event indicate that Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) droughts and Little Ice Age (LIA) droughts caused dune reactivation on the tables. Dune reactivation was accompanied by other drought-driven geomorphological responses in the WRB, including fluvial incision of the prairie and formation of sod tables. Regional significance of the MCA and LIA droughts is supported by similarities in the aeolian chronologies of the NSH at 700–600 a and some western Great Plains dune fields at 420–210 a.

Swift fox (Vulpes velox) are closely associated with short and mixed grass ecosystems, providing an opportunity to study patterns of gene flow, diversity and genetic structure in this area. We collected 589 samples throughout the species’ distribution in the United States and analyzed these samples using 15 microsatellite loci and a 250 base pair sequence of the mitochondrial DNA control region. We detected three levels of spatial genetic structure using microsatellite markers and identified six mitochondrial haplotypes, five of which showed spatial clustering. Differentiation between groups was significant while genetic diversity within groups was generally high. Anthropogenic influences, particularly agriculture, appear to reducing gene flow, especially in the central portion of the species’ range. Conservation measures should be taken to remediate these impacts and to maintain future gene flow in light of expected agricultural expansion in the Great Plains.

In 2011, the U.S. southern Great Plains, which includes Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, was plagued by moderate to extreme drought that was intensified by an extended period of recordbreaking heat. The 2011 drought presented an ideal case study to evaluate the performance of VegDRI in characterizing developing drought conditions. Assessment of the spatiotemporal drought patterns represented in the VegDRI maps showed that the severity and patterns of the drought across the region corresponded well to the record warm temperatures and much-below-normal precipitation reported by the National Climatic Data Center and the sectoral drought impacts documented by the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR). VegDRI values and maps also showed the evolution of the drought signal before the Las Conchas Fire (the largest fire in New Mexico's history). Reports in the DIR indicated that the 2011 drought had major adverse impacts on most rangeland and pastures in Texas and Oklahoma, resulting in total direct losses of more than $12 billion associated with crop, livestock, and timber production. These severe impacts on vegetation were depicted by the VegDRI at subcounty, state, and regional levels.

Oxygen isotopes from paleoproxies show a decreasing trend and an increasing variability from mid-Miocene to Pleistocene in the Southern Great Plains of the United States, where carbon isotopes indicate an overall increase of C4 plants during the same time period. Using isotope-enabled General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations, here I explore the causes of the long-term trend and variability of oxygen isotopes, ultimately to understand the climatic condition that is associated with the C4 grassland expansion. Climate model simulations were performed varying the orbital configuration, CO2 concentration, and vegetation coverage. Model results show that the isotopic composition of winter precipitation varies more than that of summer precipitation and depends strongly on temperature, or more precisely on the contribution of snow to total precipitation. I conclude that the long-term isotopic composition of precipitation decreases because of gradual cooling and varies more because of lower and more variable cold season temperature in a colder climate in response to fluctuating orbital configuration. This study implies that C4 grassland in the Southern Great Plains region expanded along with global cooling, possibly resulting from the decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. ©2019.

Assessment of drought impacts forecast by atmospheric models requires an understanding of natural drought variability, especially under conditions more arid than today. Using high-resolution lake-sediment records from the northern Great Plains, we show pronounced 100- to 130-yr drought cycles during the arid middle Holocene (8000 calendar yr BP). During drought phases, grass productivity declined, erosion and forbs increased, and fuel limitation reduced fire importance. Intervening humid decades saw grass production rise, with stabilization of soils and renewed fire as fuels became abundant. Although both C3 and C4 grasses declined during droughts, a lasting shift to C3 dominance occurred during a single drought ∼8200 calendar yr BP. During the more humid Late Holocene (2800 calendar yr BP), climate was less variable and without evident drought cyclicity. Consequently, drought severity during past, and possibly future, arid phases cannot be anticipated from the attenuated climate variability evident during contemporary humid phases. Our study demonstrates that agriculturally important grassland ecosystems respond sensitively to drought variability, uncertainty in which has profound implications for the future of these ecosystems.","Almendinger, J.E.; Clark, J.S.; Donovan, J.J.; Engstrom, D.R.; Fritz, S.C.; Grimm, E.C.","","83",2002,"C4 grassland; Climate change; Diatoms; Fire; Holocene; Limnology; Pollen analysis; δ13C","","","","","","","","",""

The late Glacial to early Holocene climate in the northern Great Plains was characterized by changes from cold and wet to cold and dry, and back to cold and wet conditions. These climatic changes were controlled by fluctuations in the positions of the Laurentide ice sheet and the extent of glacial Lake Agassiz. We speculate that the cold and dry phase may correspond to the Younger Dryas event. A salinity maximum was reached between 10.3 and 9.5 ka, after which Pickerel Lake shifted from a system controlled by atmospheric changes to a system controlled by groundwater seepage that might have been initiated by the final withdrawal of Glacial Lake Agassiz. A prairie lake was established at approximately 8.7 ka, and lasted until about 2.2 ka. During this mid-Holocene prairie period, drier conditions than today prevailed, interrupted by periods of increased moisture at about 8, 4, and 2.2 ka. Prairie conditions were more likely dry and cool rather than dry and warm. The last 2.2 ka are characterized by higher climatic variability with 400-yr aridity cycles including the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. Although the signal of changing atmospheric circulation is overprinted by fluctuations in the positions of the ice sheet and glacial Lake Agassiz during the late Glacial-Holocene transition, a combination of strong zonal circulation and strong monsoons induced by the presence of the ice sheet and high insolation may have provided mechanisms for increased precipitation. Zonal flow introducing dry Pacific air became more important during the prairie period but seems to have been interrupted by short periods of stronger meridional circulation with intrusions of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. More frequent switching between periods of zonal and meridional circulation seem to be responsible for increased climatic variability during the last 2.2 ka.","Dean, W.E.; Schwalb, A.","","20",1998,"Lake; North-central United States; Ostracodes; Paleoclimate; Postglacial; Stable isotopes","","","","","","","","",""

Developing better understandings of the dynamics at regional scales will become increasingly important as long-established land-use regimes break down in the face of climate change, resource depletion, and evolving governance. To demonstrate differential vulnerability during drought periods, this study hypothesized that observed increases in woody vegetation in grasslands would vary across land-tenure regimes. We argue that differences in State Trust Land governance, in part, lead to differential land management practices that contribute to landscape change. Methods: The study area encompasses adjacent counties, Cimarron County in Oklahoma and Union County in New Mexico, with similar climate variability and agricultural economies. We analyzed National Land Cover Database (NLCD) land-cover maps from 1992 and 2011 to assess changes in landscape composition and structure between 1992 and 2011. Results: During both years under consideration, each county in the study region, across various land-tenure regimes, was dominated by herbaceous vegetation. However, there were changes in both composition and structure across the whole study area, in particular losses of herbaceous vegetation and increases in woody vegetation. The greatest gains in woody vegetation occurred in State Trust Lands of Cimarron County. Overall, the data suggest a fragmentation of herbaceous vegetation and a coalescing of shrubland patches. Conclusions: Research about the influence of land tenure on land management decisions, specifically the role of State Trust Land leases in overgrazing, informs the broader context of drought management in the southern Great Plains. Recommendations include continued research to highlight the specific mechanisms of land-tenure governance that drive landscape change. © 2016, The Author(s).","Colston, N.M.; Fagin, T.D.; Graham, A.; Vadjunec, J.M.; Wenger, K.","","5",2016,"Agriculture; Drought; Grasslands; Land tenure; Landscape composition; Landscape structure; National Land Cover Database (NLCD); Socio-ecological vulnerability; Southern Great Plains","","","","","","","","",""

However, accurate estimates of these shifts are dependent on long-term data sets that include phenological observations from before annual average temperatures began to rise. Methods: We compared the first flowering times of native prairie plants between 2007 and 2010 with historical data recorded by O. A. Stevens from 1910 to 1961. By merging climate variable data from the same time period, it also was possible to correlate first flowering dates with associated climate variables. Key results: Over the past 100 years, spring temperatures in the Red River Valley near Fargo, North Dakota, USA, have increased, and growing seasons have lengthened significantly. Seventy-five percent of the 178 species observed by Stevens had flowering times that were sensitive to at least one variable related to temperature or precipitation. Over the past 4 yr, 5% to 17% of the species observed have significantly shifted their first flowering time either earlier or later relative to the previous century. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that as spring temperatures in the northern Great Plains have increased and the growing season has lengthened, some spring flowering species have advanced their first flowering time, some fall species have delayed their first flowering, and some species have not changed. Given the importance of flowering timing for reproductive success, the changing climate in the Great Plains is expected to have long-term ecological and evolutionary consequences for native plant species. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.","Dunnell, K.L.; Travers, S.E.","","98",2011,"Climate change; Flowering; Minnesota; North Dakota; Phenology; Prairie","","","","","","","","",""

Atmospheric moisture budget components, computed from the ARM variational analysis data, are compared between different wet/dry scenarios and convection regimes. Consistent with previous studies, large-scale moisture flux convergence dominates the SGP regional moisture budget on the daily time scale, but surface evaporation does play a more prominent role on late-afternoon deep convection days. Moreover, the relationship between moisture flux convergence and precipitation increases significantly from dry year to wet years. The land-atmosphere coupling strength is quantified for local convective events within the “Local L-A Coupling Process Chain” (Santanello et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-17-0001.1). The impact of land surface on the evolution of planetary boundary layer is highly dependent on the vegetation leaf area index. A significantly larger surface sensible heat flux is found over the SGP forest region in midsummer, which is accompanied by a much higher planetary boundary layer development and a large increase in shallow cumulus cloud fraction.

To evaluate the land cover changes resulting from recent (2000–2015) development, the area and previous land cover of all well pads (pads) constructed during this time were determined, the amount of disturbed and reclaimed land adjacent to pads was estimated, land cover changes were analyzed over time for three different well types, and the effects from future development were predicted. The previous land cover of the 12,990 ha converted to pads was predominately agricultural (49.5%) or prairie (47.4%) with lesser amounts of developed (2.3%), aquatic (0.5%), and forest (0.4%). Additionally, 12,121 ha has likely been disturbed and reclaimed. The area required per gas well remained constant through time while the land required per oil well increased initially and then decreased as development first shifted from conventional to unconventional drilling and then to multi-bore pads. For non-oil-and-gas wells (i.e. stratigraphic test wells, water wells, and injection wells), the area per well increased through time likely due to increased produced water disposal requirements. Future land cover change is expected to be 2.7 times greater than recent development with much of the development occurring in five counties in the core Bakken development area. Direct land cover change and disturbance from recent and expected development are predicted to affect 0.4% of the landscape across the basin; however, in the core Bakken development area, 2.3% of the landscape will be affected including 2.1% of the remaining grassland. Although future development will result in significant land cover change, evolving industry practices and proactive siting decisions, such as development along energy corridors and placing pads in areas previously altered by human activity, have the potential to reduce the ecological effects of future energy development in the Williston Basin. © 2016","Kim, K.; Preston, T.M.","","566-567",2016,"Agriculture; Disturbance; Land use change; Oil and gas development; Prairie; Reclamation","","","","","","","","",""

A management technique known as patch-burn grazing was used to mimic the heterogeneity in vegetation created by the historical disturbance regime of fire and grazing in sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) rangelands. We compared nest survival of Cassin's sparrows (Peucaea cassinii), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and lark sparrows (Chondestes grammacus); species richness; and densities of 11 bird species between rangelands managed with patch-burn grazing and rangelands managed with traditional management (i.e., seasonal grazing) in Oklahoma from 2006 to 2008. Estimates of nest survival were similar between patch-burn and traditional pastures (Cassin's sparrows: 51% and 57%; field sparrows: 18% and 22%; and lark sparrows: 14% and 12%, patch-burn and traditional, respectively). Species richness was higher in patch-burn pastures compared to traditionally managed pastures. Densities of the majority of avian species (73%) were similar between treatments; however, lark sparrow densities were 5 times more abundant in patch-burn pastures and grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were >3 times more abundant on traditional pastures. Our results suggest that introducing patch-burn grazing management to sand sagebrush rangelands is not detrimental to nesting shrubland birds, and the creation of heterogeneity through patch-burn grazing can increase avian species diversity. Furthermore, some species such as lark sparrows may benefit from patch-burn grazing.

In the western Great Plains, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) woodlands are expanding across broad geographical and environmental gradients. The objective of this study was to reconstruct the establishment of ponderosa pine in woodlands in the west-central Great Plains and to identify whether it was mediated by climate variability. Location: Our study took place in a 400-km wide region from the base of the Front Range Mountains (c. 105° W) to the central Great Plains (c. 100° W) and from Nebraska (43° N) to northern New Mexico (36° N), USA. Methods: Dates for establishment of ponderosa pine were reconstructed with tree rings in 11 woodland sites distributed across the longitudinal and latitudinal gradients of the study area. Temporal trends in decadal pine establishment were compared with summer Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Annual trends in pine establishment from 1985 to 2005 were compared with seasonal PDSI, temperature and moisture availability. Results: Establishment of ponderosa pine occurred in the study area in all but one decade (1770s) between the 1750s and the early 2000s, with over 35% of establishment in the region occurring after 1980. Pine establishment was highly variable among sites. Across the region, decadal pine establishment was persistently low from 1940 to 1960, when PDSI was below average. Annual pine establishment from 1985 to 2005 was positively correlated with summer PDSI and inversely correlated with minimum spring temperatures. Main conclusions: Most ponderosa pine woodlands pre-date widespread Euro-American settlement of the region around c. ad 1860 and currently have stable tree populations. High variability in the timing of establishment of pine among sites highlights the multiplicity of factors that can drive woodland dynamics, including land use, fire history, CO2 enrichment, tree population dynamics and climate. Since the 1840s, the influence of climate was most notable across the study area during the mid-20th century, when the establishment of pine was suppressed by two significant droughts. The past sensitivity of establishment of ponderosa pine to drought suggests that woodland expansion will be negatively affected by predicted increases in temperature and drought in the Great Plains. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Jackson, S.T.; Kaye, M.W.; Woodhouse, C.A.","","37",2010,"Climate; Dendrochronology; Drought; Establishment; Great Plains; Pinus ponderosa; Ponderosa pine; USA; Woodland expansion","","","","","","","","",""

We examined rangewide patterns of genetic (mtDNA and microsatellites) and morphological diversity within the Lark Sparrow (Chondestes grammacus), focusing on diversity patterns across potentially independent Western, Central, and Eastern USA regional breeding zones. Phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequences did not support phylogeographic patterns associated with previously characterized subspecies, though the presence of regionally specific clades suggests incipient evolutionary diversification. Regional differentiation was evidenced by significant differences in morphological traits, significant levels of genetic differentiation, reduced estimates of migration among regions, and the characterization of 2 distinct populations through Bayesian clustering. Morphometric and genetic variation distinguished Western Lark Sparrow populations historically characterized as subspecies C. g. actitus from conspecifics across a secondary cline. By contrast, regional variation between Central and Eastern populations, encompassing subspecies C. g. strigatus and C. g. grammacus, was less pronounced and was consistent with a primary cline across the American Great Plains.

The population genetic structure of dominant plant species in response to a cline of these variables has rarely been addressed. We evaluated the spatial genetic structure and diversity of Andropogon gerardii populations across the U.S. Great Plains precipitation gradient, ranging from approximately 48 cm/year to 105 cm/year. Methodology/Principal Findings: Genomic diversity was evaluated with AFLP markers and diversity of a disease resistance gene homolog was evaluated by PCR-amplification and digestion with restriction enzymes. We determined the degree of spatial genetic structure using Mantel tests. Genomic and resistance gene homolog diversity were evaluated across prairies using Shannon's index and by averaging haplotype dissimilarity. Trends in diversity across prairies were determined using linear regression of diversity on average precipitation for each prairie. We identified significant spatial genetic structure, with genomic similarity decreasing as a function of distance between samples. However, our data indicated that genome-wide diversity did not vary consistently across the precipitation gradient. In contrast, we found that disease resistance gene homolog diversity was positively correlated with precipitation. Significance: Prairie remnants differ in the genetic resources they maintain. Selection and evolution in this disease resistance homolog is environmentally dependent. Overall, we found that, though this environmental gradient may not predict genomic diversity, individual traits such as disease resistance genes may vary significantly. © 2011 Rouse et al.","Garrett, K.A.; Hulbert, S.H.; Keeler, K.H.; Rouse, M.N.; Saleh, A.A.; Seck, A.; Travers, S.E.","","6",2011,"","","","","","","","","",""

These proxies were tested on various modern grassland communities of the central and southern Great Plains, including areas with bison, cattle, and small herbivores, and areas under different fire frequencies.Opal phytolith assemblages and δ13C values show that before cal 11ka, C3 grasses and woody plants predominated in areas that today are dominated by C4 grasses. The origin of the shortgrass prairie dates back to about cal 10ka. The origin of the tallgrass prairie, however, is not clear as phytolith data show variable assemblages throughout the Holocene (mixed-grass, tallgrass, and tallgrass-woodland mosaic). Different proxies (burnt phytoliths vs. charcoal) reveal different fire frequencies, but it is apparent that microfossil evidence for fire incidence is closely related to the abundance of woody plants in the landscape.Before cal 12. ka, soils show somewhat elevated concentration of Sporormiella, but lower concentrations than the modern high-density bison and cattle grazing areas.

Any impact of climate on vegetation can manifest in terms of changes in plant growth characteristics, its health and timing of different vegetative phenomena, such as germination, bud burst, maturity, etc. The duration and changes in the timing of plant growth stages can in turn impact the global carbon cycle. Similarly any change in plant productivity, because of changing climate will alter the carbon flux pattern by changing the overall biological flux being added or taken away from the atmosphere. We have used satellite data to study spatiotemporal changes in the plant phenology and plant productivity over the Continental USA (CONUS) to get an overall understanding of the evolution of these metrics over the past decade. Our study reveals that the prairies situated in the heartland of CONUS have become an increasingly important player in determining any changes in vegetation induced carbon source/sink patterns. The northern Great Plains has shown increased fixation of carbon in recent years, while the southern Plains has become a carbon source. This has been largely driven by changes in recent weather patterns where the northern plains have seen an increasingly cooler and wetter growing season whereas the southern plains have at the same time seen increased aridity, especially since 2011. This is also reflected in increasing growing season greenness values over the northern Plains and the opposite over the southern Plains.

However, while a penecontemporaneous record from further south within the same region indicated significant spatial and temporal variability in C<inf>4</inf> abundance, the new record indicates relatively little change either in space or in time.

Dunes here overlie late Quaternary alluvium and were reactivated extensively in the late Holocene. Geomorphic and soil evidence suggests that the most likely eolian sand source is the Arkansas River valley to the northwest. Nevertheless, orientations of stabilized dunes indicate that the most recent dune-forming winds came from the south or southwest, in agreement with modern wind data. Mineralogy and trace element concentrations in eolian sands of the Great Bend Sand Prairie are similar to those to the Arkansas River, which permits the Arkansas River as a sediment source. Ca and Sr abundances, which reflect small amounts of carbonate minerals, are higher in Arkansas River sand compared to eolian sands and show a systematic depletion away from the Arkansas River to the southeast. These trends are likely due to carbonate mineral depletion downwind from abrasion and size reduction. Thus, paleowinds probably were northwesterly during initial deposition. Northwesterly winds occur today when dry, Pacific-derived air is dominant. We hypothesize that the residence time of this air mass was much greater while dunes initially formed, possibly during a warmer and drier mid-Holocene period. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

Playa wetlands are ubiquitous features of the High Plains and have experienced increased sediment accumulation, which is the primary cause of reduced playa ecosystem function. Seven playas on the High Plains of western Kansas, five with cropland-dominated watersheds and two with grassland-dominated watersheds, were examined to quantify the amount of recent (past ~100–175 yr) sediment accumulated within playas and to establish chronologies of playa filling. Thicknesses of recent sediment were determined in the field, and soil cores were extracted from study playas. Four playa cores were analyzed for 210Pb to establish the chronology of recent sediment accumulation and sedimentation rates. Chronologies of pre-agricultural sediments and sedimentation rates were calculated by 14C dating of buried soils preserved within playa cores. Radiocarbon ages indicate playa stratigraphic records span the Holocene and that these playas have persisted on the landscape since at least the Late Pleistocene. Long-term, natural sedimentation rates were highest during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and early Holocene, at ~2–4 cm/century.

Sediments deposited between 12 and 6 ka (radiocarbon) show extreme variations in composition, oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of bulk carbonate, carbon isotopic composition of organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility. These variations reflect changes in sources of moisture, regional vegetation types, precipitation-evaporation balance, ground- and surface-water influx, water residence time, erosion, lake productivity, water level, and water temperature. The total carbonate content of late Pleistocene sediments steadily increased from &lt;20% at the base of the core to as much as 80% in sediments deposited between 11 and 9 ka. By about 8 ka, the total carbonate content of the sediments had declined to about 40% where it remained with little variation for the past 8 kyr, suggesting relatively stable conditions. There are marked increases in values of δ13C and δ18O in bulk carbonate, and δ13C of organic matter, in sediments deposited between 10 and 6 ka as evaporation increased, and the vegetation in the watershed changed from forest to prairie. This shift toward more 18O-enriched carbonate may also reflect a change in source or seasonality of precipitation. During this early Holocene interval the organic carbon (OC) content of the sediments remained relatively low (2-3%), but then increased rapidly to 4.5% between 7 and 6 ka, reflecting the rapid transition to a prairie lake. The OC content fluctuates slightly between 4 and 6% in sediments deposited over the past 6 kyr. Like OC and total carbonate, most variables measured show little variation in the 13 m of sediment deposited over the past 6 kyr, particularly when compared with early Holocene variations. Although the magnetic susceptibility of this upper 13 m of sediment is generally low (&lt;10 SI units), the upper six meters of the section is marked by striking 1 m cycles (ca. 400-500 yr periodicity) in susceptibility. These cycles are interpreted as being due to variations in the influx of eolian detrital-clastic material. Century-scale cyclic variations in different proxy variables for aridity and eolian activity from sediments deposited over the past 2000 yr in other lakes in the northern Great Plains, as well as in sand dune activity, suggest that aridity cycles were the dominant feature of late Holocene climate of the northern Great Plains.

Eolian landforms consist of sand sheets and northwest-trending parabolic dunes. Dunes and sand sheets in the Minot field are presently stabilized by a cover of prairie grasses or oak woodland. Stratigraphic studies and accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating of paleosols indicate at least two periods of eolian sand movement in the late Holocene. Pedologic data suggest that all of the dune field has experienced late Holocene dune activity, though not all parts of the dune field may have been active simultaneously. Similar immobile element (Ti, Zr, La, Ce) concentrations support the interpretation that eolian sands are derived from local glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine sediments. However, glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial source sediments have high Ca concentrations from carbonate minerals, whereas dune sands are depleted in Ca. Because noneolian-derived soils in the area are calcareous, these data indicate that the Minot dune field may have had extended periods of activity in the Holocene, such that eolian abrasion removed soft carbonate minerals. The southwest-facing parts of some presently stabilized dunes were active during the 1930s drought, but were revegetated during the wetter years of the 1940s. These observations indicate that severe droughts accompanied by high temperatures are the most likely cause of Holocene eolian activity.","Been, J.; Burdett, J.; Mahan, S.A.; Muhs, D.R.; Rowland, Z.M.; Skipp, G.; Stafford Jr., T.W.","","34",1997,"","","","","","","","","",""

Combined with the spread of grass-dominated habitats, it has been suggested that the MMCO lead to significant turnover and modernization of fauna and flora. However, records documenting local vegetation change during the MMCO are rare, hence this hypothesis remains largely untested. Herein, we combine phytolith assemblages and δ13C records from paleosol organic matter from the Railroad Canyon section (RCS), eastern Idaho, to provide the first direct, detailed, and continuous, long-term record of vegetation composition and structure in a single basin during the lead-up to the MMCO (22.9–15.2 Ma; late Arikareean–early Barstovian). Phytolith assemblage analysis indicates that grasses, primarily C3 pooids, dominated early–middle Miocene vegetation. Potential C4 PACMAD grasses were present by ca. 21.6–20.7 Ma (late Arikareean) and vary in abundance (0.4–17.2% of diagnostic phytoliths) through the section. Although relatively rare overall, PACMAD grasses decrease significantly through time, in parallel with declining diatom abundances and an increase in pooid grasses. In contrast, paleosol δ13Corg indicates 0–29.1% C4 vegetation but no consistent temporal change. Where both phytolith- and isotope-based estimates are made from the same paleosol, they are within error most (82%) of the time; thus, the apparent discrepancy in temporal trends could either be due to differences in the resolution of the two records, or could be explained if many PACMADs were not C4 grasses, but instead water-loving C3 species. Overall, these data suggest that open-habitat mosaic vegetation with grass-dominated grasslands and open woodlands occurred in the North Rocky Mountains, USA, by at least the early Miocene, more comparable to the timing for the spread of grass-dominated habitats in the Great Plains than previously thought. Additionally, phytolith data suggest that overall vegetation structure remained relatively stable throughout the RCS, inconsistent with published paleosol morphology data. This points to regionally unique floral patterns decoupled from global climate change leading into the MMCO. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Harris, E.B.; Sheldon, N.D.; Smith, S.Y.; Strömberg, C.A.E.; Vilhena, D.A.","","485",2017,"Paleoecology; Paleovegetation; Phytoliths; Railroad Canyon; Stable isotope geochemistry","","","","","","","","",""

Previous modeling studies simulated the impact of woody plant encroachment on hydrological processes using models calibrated and constrained primarily by historic streamflow from intermediate sized watersheds. In this study, we calibrated the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT model), a widely used model for cropping and grazing systems, for a prolifically encroaching juniper species, eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), in the south-central Great Plains using species-specific biophysical and hydrological parameters and in situ meteorological forcing from three pairs of experimental watersheds (grassland versus eastern redcedar woodland) for a period of 3-years covering a dry-to-wet cycle. The multiple paired watersheds eliminated the potentially confounding edaphic and topographic influences from changes in hydrological processes related to woody encroachment. The SWAT model was optimized with the Shuffled complexes with Principal component analysis (SP-UCI) algorithm developed from the Shuffled Complexes Evolution (SCE_UA). The mean Nash-Sutcliff coefficient (NSCE) values of the calibrated model for daily and monthly runoff from experimental watersheds reached 0.96 and 0.97 for grassland, respectively, and 0.90 and 0.84 for eastern redcedar woodland, respectively. We then validated the calibrated model with a nearby, larger watershed undergoing rapid eastern redcedar encroachment. The NSCE value for monthly streamflow over a period of 22. years was 0.79. We provide detailed biophysical and hydrological parameters for tallgrass prairie under moderate grazing and eastern redcedar, which can be used to calibrate any model for further validation and application by the hydrologic modeling community. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Qiao, L.; Stebler, E.; Will, R.E.; Zou, C.B.","","523",2015,"Ecosystem services; Great Plains; Juniper; Rangeland; Upscaling; Water resources","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis of thirty-eight AMS radiocarbon ages, δ13C values, and modern weather data has produced a 12,800calyr record of changing C3-C4 vegetation, temperature, and precipitation. The record begins with the Younger Dryas that was characterized by C3 plants and was about 2.4°C cooler with over 100mm rainfall than today. After 11,000calyrs BP, the climate became less cool and less wet, reaching present-day conditions by 9000yrs. The middle Holocene was C4, warm, and dry although the δ13C record is incomplete for this interval. From 3300 to 1400calyrs BP, the climate was cool and wet with C3 plants, averaging 0.5°C cooler and 22mm greater rainfall than today, matching other records in the region for a wetter climate. After 1400calyrs BP, the local climate became warm and dry, shifting to C4 vegetation. The severe second century drought, first observed in tree-rings in southern Colorado, is supported by the δ13C data and occurred during the interval A.D. 40 to A.D. 180.

The objective of this study was to characterize and compare hydraulic properties of fine-stextured soils on adjacent native grassland, recently tilled cropland, and reestablished grassland in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) at three locations in the Southern Great Plains. A tension infiltrometer was used to measure unconfined, unsaturated infiltration over a range of supply pressure heads (nominally, h = - 150, - 100, - 50, and - 5 mm H2O) at the soil surface. Intact soil cores were sampled within the Ap and Bt horizons to determine bulk density and water desorption curves, θ(h), at potentials ranging from - 0.15 to - 100 kPa. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity K(h) over the range in supply pressure heads was estimated using Wooding's equation for steady-state flow from a disc source. The van Genuchten water retention model was fitted to θ(h) data to estimate parameter values. Soils in CRP had greater surface bulk densities than their grassland and cropland counterparts. The shape of the soil water retention curve for grassland and CRP land were similar, suggesting that converted croplands had fully reconsolidated. Mean near-saturated hydraulic conductivities of cropland at h = - 5 mm were not significantly different from grassland. However, at - 150 mm supply pressure head, cropped soils had a mean unsaturated conductivity 2.3 and 4.1 times greater than CRP land and grassland, respectively. Sites in CRP had the lowest (P &lt; 0.05) near-saturated hydraulic conductivities (h = - 5 mm), which suggest that after 10 years, grasses had not fully ameliorated changes in pore structure caused by tillage. Comparison of unsaturated conductivities for grassland and CRP land suggest that long-term structural development on native grasslands was principally confined to effective pore radii greater than 300 μm. Land use practices had a greater effect on water movement than did soil series, indicating that the modifying effects of tillage, reconsolidation, and pore structure evolution on hydraulic properties are important processes governing water movement in these fine-textured soils. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Beacon Island is a multi-component archaeological site that includes an Agate Basin (Paleoindian) component consisting of the butchered remains of at least 29 Bison antiquus, along with projectile point fragments and other artifacts. The bison bonebed is a product of a single kill at ca. 10,300 B.P. and is buried in a shallow kettle basin. The basin formed around 16,000-15,000B.P. and initially trapped loess comprising the Mallard Island Member of the Oahe Formation; other members of the Oahe Formation subsequently filled the basin. Conditions probably were relatively dry when the Mallard Island Member aggraded, but by ca. 10,300B.P. paludal deposits comprising the Aggie Brown Member began to accumulate in the basin, indicating a shift to wetter conditions. Based on phytolith and stable carbon isotope data, cool-season C3 prairie species dominated the site at the time of the bison kill, and the micromammal faunal assemblage suggests that this boreal grassland may have been punctuated by stands of shrubby vegetation. Slight warming and drying occurred soon after ca. 10,300B.P., indicated by relatively higher δ13C values determined on soil organic matter and a significant increase in concentrations of microscopic particulate charcoal and drought-resistant Stipa-type phytoliths, but paludal deposits continued to aggrade, resulting in deep burial of the bonebed. Sedimentation was relatively slow in the basin, allowing soil development to keep up with deposition. This cumulization process resulted in the formation of an overthickened A horizon in the Aggie Brown Member, typical of the Leonard Paleosol. Aggradation of the Aggie Brown Member ceased by ca. 8000B.P., and loess comprising the Pick City Member began accumulating soon after that time, likely marking the initiation of the warm, dry Altithermal climatic episode. Isotope and phytolith data also point to a warmer and probably drier climate after 8000B.P., indicated by higher δ13C values and the appearance of warm-season C4 chloridoids at the site. Hence the Agate Basin occupation coincided with the coolest and perhaps the wettest climatic episode recorded in the sampled deposits. However, it is likely that the people associated with the Agate Basin culture at Beacon Island did not experience environmental conditions dramatically different from the modern conditions at the site. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Mandel, R.D.; Mitchell, M.D.; Murphy, L.R.","","342",2014,"Agate basin complex; Northern great plains; Oahe formation; Paleopedology; Phytoliths; Stable carbon isotopes","","","","","","","","",""

From 8500 to 5800 yr BP, upland forest elements disappeared, and even riparian trees were sparse under dry climatic conditions. Alluvial fans continued to aggrade but aggradation in the main valley was interrupted by a stable episode 7000 yr BP. From 5800 to 3100 yr BP, riparian forests returned to prominence, and droughts were intermittent. Alluviation was slower and punctuated by two major episodes of channel incision and terrace formation in the main valley. Aggradation on alluvial fans slowed and finally ceased near the end of this period.

Habitats became similar to presettlement conditions during the last 2700 yr BP. Weedy taxa dominate modern samples, reflecting widespread disturbance.

Without adaptive variation studies, restoration may be misguided. We test the extent to which climate in central US grasslands exerts selection pressure on a foundation grass big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), widely used in restorations, and resulting in local adaptation. We seeded three regional ecotypes of A. gerardii in reciprocal transplant garden communities across 1150 km precipitation gradient. We measured ecological responses over several timescales (instantaneous gas exchange, medium-term chlorophyll absorbance, and long-term responses of establishment and cover) in response to climate and biotic factors and tested if ecotypes could expand range. The ecotype from the driest region exhibited greatest cover under low rainfall, suggesting local adaptation under abiotic stress. Unexpectedly, no evidence for cover differences between ecotypes exists at mesic sites where establishment and cover of all ecotypes were low, perhaps due to strong biotic pressures. Expression of adaptive differences is strongly environment specific. Given observed adaptive variation, the most conservative restoration strategy would be to plant the local ecotype, especially in drier locations. With superior performance of the most xeric ecotype under dry conditions and predicted drought, this ecotype may migrate eastward, naturally or with assistance in restorations. © 2015 The Authors.

Unfortunately, many of our native grasses are more difficult to establish and are not as competitive with these exotic weedy grasses as their introduced counterparts, including crested and Siberian wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum, A. desertorum, and A. fragile).

Prosopis glandulosa invasion has also facilitated growth of the C3 mid-grass species, Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha [Trin &amp; Rupr.] Pohl) initially beneath its canopy but extending to interspaces between P. glandulosa as stand density increases. Little is known about the stability of the Prosopis/Nassella association or C4 grass recovery following P. glandulosa disturbance. We quantified C3 and C4 grass production in interspaces, and basal cover in interspaces and P. glandulosa subcanopy microsites for 9 years following P. glandulosa suppression (top-kill) and compared this to untreated P. glandulosa woodland (woodland). The Prosopis/Nassella association limited the window of C4 mid-grass recovery to only a few years. Nassella leucotricha dominated grass production during the first 3 years after top-kill. C4 mid-grass recovery began in year 4, but was interrupted by severe drought in years 5 through 7. Recovery resumed in year 8, due to above-average summer rainfall, but P. glandulosa regrowth was large enough by this time to limit C4 mid-grass production to a third of its potential. Nassella leucotricha basal cover remained dominant and stable in woodland subcanopy microsites, even during drought, and only briefly declined in top-kill subcanopy microsites before returning to pretreatment levels by year 8 as P. glandulosa regrowth increased and provided shade. Synthesis and applications. A single suppression event had little impact on disrupting the Prosopis/Nassella association and allowing C4 mid-grass recovery.

As climate warmed, brackish and alkaline conditions developed coincident with shallowing of the pond at the end of Zone III.

Radiocarbon ages obtained from total humates in buried soils suggest that five periods of late-Holocene stability and soil formation are preserved in dune fields at approximately 2300, 1400, 1000, 700, 500 and 300 years B.P. Reactivation of aeolian sand in the past 1000 years has resulted in a variety of well defined, parabolic dunes. In general, events in the region correspond with established chronologies elsewhere on the Great Plains and in particular correlate well with dune fields in north-eastern Colorado. Overall, results indicate that the threshold of landscape stability on the Great Bend Sand Prairie can easily be crossed in the current climatic regime.","Arbogast, A.F.","","34",1996,"Holocene; Kansas; aeolian; sand dunes; stability","","","","","","","","",""

At that site, about 3 m of mainly pond and stream deposits overlies Cretaceous bedrock and underlies Quaternary till and loess. All of the deposits have normal magnetic polarity. Further, the lower pond and stream deposits have yielded an interesting collection of mammal bones. Taxa identified include rabbit or hare, ground squirrel, prairie dog, bog lemming, canids, cats, badger, elephant, horses, camel, and shrub-ox. The identified taxa tentatively imply a late Irvingtonian Land Mammal Age for the fauna. This, along with their preglacial setting and normal polarity, indicates that the pond and stream deposits were laid down near the beginning of the Brunhes Polarity Chron (about 0.7 Ma) and so provide a maximum limit for the first glaciation of the region. Together, the fauna and deposits offer an interesting glimpse at conditions prevailing on the High Plains of the region at that time, which apparently resembled the dry, treeless grassland found there at present. © 1988 Geological Society of America.","Barendregt, R.W.; Churcher, C.S.; Stalker, A.M.","","100",1988,"","","","","","","","","",""

Gray, poisonous native weeds of rangelands of the southwestern United States. In Argentina, the weevil occurs in semiarid regions from Tucuman south to Chubut, which are climatically similar to broad areas of the southwestern United States. Laboratory-reared females lived ca. 112 days and laid ca. 117 eggs. The eggs hatched in ca. 15 days. The larvae had eight instars; they required ca. 151 days and pupae ca. 27 days to develop. Adult weevils emerged from the taproots in early summer, fed on the leaves and terminals, and oviposited mostly in the crown near the soil line. The feeding of one or more pairs of caged adults killed medium-sized plants. The larvae tunneled downward to the taproot where they pupated. They overwintered in the taproots of these perennial host plants and pupated in the spring. A generation required 1 year but some individuals probably required two growing seasons. At Peninsula Valdes, Chubut, H. ventralis preferred Gutierrezia solbrigii Cabrera to Grindelia chiloensis (Corn.) Cabrera by a ratio of 1.9 to 1.0. In the field there, crowns of large Gu. solbrigii (average 60 cm canopy diameter) contained an average 5.0 larvae per plant, those of small plants (23 cm diameter) contained 1.1 larvae, and plants smaller than 10 cm rarely contained larvae. No insect parasitoids or predators were found attacking any stage. H. ventralis probably evolved on xerophytic, temperate Astereae, from ancestors of the genus Heilipus that fed on species of ancient, hygrophytic, tropical plant families.","Cordo, H.A.; DeLoach, C.J.; Habeck, D.H.","","15",1999,"Biocontrol-weeds; Biological control; Broomweed; Gutierrezia; Heilipodus ventralis; Insect biology; Rangeland weeds; Snakeweed; Weevil biology","","","","","","","","",""

Hibbard for a fossil assemblage recovered from silty clays beneath the ""Pearlette"" volcanic ash at the type Cudahy ash pit and other sites in Meade County, Kansas. The ""Pearlette"" ash comprises several variously dated Yellowstone ashes. The Cudahy (=Lava Creek B) ash is most recently dated at 0.639 ± 0.002 Ma and is an important geochronologic marker in the Great Plains. The term Cudahy Ash Pit local fauna is now used for that of the type locality, although other Cudahy-type (Cudahyan) local faunas have been described. From 1968 to 1971, 30 tons of silty clay and diatomite were collected from below outcrops of Lava Creek B ash at elevations of 988-1058 m (3240-3470 ft) in the High Plains of the Texas Panhandle. Screenwashing yielded about 30 mammal taxa and numerous small amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mollusks. Four local faunas (Woody Draw, Bull Draw, Deadman's Creek, and Mayfield Ranch) are recognized. These faunas, dominated by shrews and microtine (arvicoline) rodents, are compositionally similar to each other and to the Cudahy and Sunbrite ash pit local faunas of Meade County even though the Panhandle sites are 300-340 km (186-211 miles) southwest of the Kansas sites and are 213-280 m (700-920 ft) higher in elevation. The Panhandle faunas contain two new species of Sorex as well as Sorex cf. cinereus, Sorex cudahyensis, Sorex lacustris, Sorex (Microsorex) pratensis, Sorex megapalustris, Blarina, Cynomys, Spermophilus, Geomys tobinensis, Thomomys cf. talpoides, Peromyscus cragini, Reithrodontomys moorei, Ondatra annectens, Mictomys meltoni, Microtus llanensis (rare), Microtus paroperarius, and Microtus meadensis. The large sample size of the latter two taxa permits statistical comparisons of teeth with those from Kansas. The Texas faunas further substantiate the Cudahyan as a subage of the Irvingtonian between the older Sappan and younger Sheridanian subages and equivalent to Irvingtonian II based on microtine (arvicoline) rodents. Local habitats consisted of ponds or playas with marshy areas suitable for shrews, muskrats, and bog lemmings. Moist grassy meadows nearby would have been inhabited by voles, mice, and some of the shrews; the less abundant gophers, ground squirrels, and prairie dog would have preferred drier, grassy uplands with well-drained soils.

We used a matched-pairs design with plots in burned and non-burned areas to study effects of the East Amarillo Complex (EAC) wildfires on mixed grass prairie mean community composition and variability in composition. Species composition and ground cover data were collected at 5 study sites each year for three years following the EAC. Fire effects on mean species composition were analyzed with permutational analyses of variance; temporal patterns were analyzed with permutational anova and nonmetric multidimensional scaling; and an index of multivariate dispersion was used to assess variability in plant community composition. We found weak immediate impacts (year 1) of wildfire on mean species composition, but strong impacts by year three. Two general patterns of changes in mean species composition emerged: at 3 study sites, there was a progressive divergence in similarity between burned and non-burned areas following wildfire whereas at 2 study sites, wildfire effects lessened over time. In contrast, a trend of increased homogeneity in burned vegetation relative to non-burned vegetation was apparent at all 5 study sites 2 to 3 years post-fire; burned areas also had higher species diversity, higher evenness but similar species richness 3 years post-fire. Ground cover composition, which was immediately impacted by wildfire through removal of residual dry matter, was fully recovered to non-burned conditions 3 years after wildfire. We observed little seedling recruitment either of native or exotic species following wildfire. Community composition changes in burned areas were likely the result of changing dominance relationships among plants that survived the wildfires rather than the result of recruitment of new individuals in gaps created by dead plants. Given the growth form of perennial C4 grasses and the fact that these grasslands evolved in the context of repeated fire, it is likely that changes in mean species composition and compositional variability are short-term responses. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","Britton, C.M.; Rideout-Hanzak, S.; Wester, D.B.; Whitlaw, H.","","15",2014,"Fire ecology; Multivariate dispersion; Nonmetric multidimensional scaling; Permutational analysis of variance; Vegetation composition","","","","","","","","",""

The role of BC in the global carbon cycle is still unclear. This study aimed to quantify and characterize BC in major grassland ecosystems of the world. Twenty-eight representative soil profiles (mainly Mollisols) were sampled in the Russian Steppe, the U.S. Great Plains, the Argentinian Pampa, the Manchurian Plains in China, and the Chernozem region in central Germany. Black carbon contents were estimated using benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) as a molecular marker, and indications about the origin of the BC were derived from bulk and compound-specific δ13C analyses and radiocarbon dating of bulk soil organic matter (SOM). Our findings suggest that between 5% and 30% of SOC stocks consist of BC. Maximum BC contributions to SOC frequently were found at deeper parts of the A horizon with 14C ages younger than 7000 years BP; that is, incorporation of C as charred particles accompanied ecosystem development since the mid-Holocene. Most of this BC formed from local vegetation, as indicated by a 13C isotope signature similar to that of bulk SOM. At some sites, also nonlocal sources contributed to soil BC, e.g., fossil fuel BC inputs at the German sites. Black carbon stocks were highest in Chernozems and lowest in Kastanozems. The Russian Steppe and Chinese Manchurian sites stored about 3-4 times more BC (around 3 kg m-2) than did the other sites because of thicker A horizons that were rich in BC.

Prey species are thought to filter information on perceived predator encounter rates in physical landscapes into a landscape of fear defined by spatially explicit heterogeneity in predation risk. The presence of multiple predators using different hunting strategies further complicates navigation through a landscape of fear and potentially exposes prey to greater risk of predation. The juxtaposition of land cover types likely influences overlap in occurrence of different predators, suggesting that attributes of a landscape of fear result from complexity in the physical landscape. Woody encroachment in grasslands furnishes an example of increasing complexity with the potential to influence predator distributions. We examined the role of vegetation structure on the distribution of two avian predators, Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus), and the vulnerability of a frequent prey species of those predators, Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We mapped occurrences of the raptors and kill locations of Northern Bobwhite to examine spatial vulnerability patterns in relation to landscape complexity. We use an offset model to examine spatially explicit habitat use patterns of these predators in the Southern Great Plains of the United States, and monitored vulnerability patterns of their prey species based on kill locations collected during radio telemetry monitoring. Both predator density and predation-specific mortality of Northern Bobwhite increased with vegetation complexity generated by fine-scale interspersion of grassland and woodland. Predation pressure was lower in more homogeneous landscapes where overlap of the two predators was less frequent. Predator overlap created areas of high risk for Northern Bobwhite amounting to 32% of the land area where landscape complexity was high and 7% where complexity was lower. Our study emphasizes the need to evaluate the role of landscape structure on predation dynamics and reveals another threat from woody encroachment in grasslands. © 2017 The Authors.

The two sampling periods differed climatically. The earlier sampling took place during normal to slightly dry conditions, whereas the latter occurred during and immediately following exceptionally wet conditions. As reported previously in Mushet et al. (2015), the dominant effect was expansion of the area of these lakes and dilution of their major ions. However, within that context, there were significant differences in the evolutionary pathways of major ions. To establish these pathways, we employed the inverse modeling computer code NetpathXL. This code takes the initial and final lake composition and, using mass balance constrained by the composition of diluting waters, and input and output of phases, calculates plausible geochemical evolution pathways. Despite the fact that in most cases major ions decreased, a subset of the lakes had an increase in SO4 2−. This distinction is significant because SO4 2− is the dominant anion in a majority of Prairie Pothole Region wetlands and lakes. For lakes with decreasing SO4 2−, the proportion of original lake water required for mass balance was subordinate to rainwater and/or overland flow. In contrast, lakes with increasing SO4 2− between the two sampling episodes tended to be dominated by original lake water. This suite of lakes tended to be smaller and have lower initial SO4 2− concentrations such that inputs of sulfur from dissolution of the minerals gypsum or pyrite had a significant impact on the final sulfur concentration given the lower dilution factors. Thus, our study provides context for how Prairie Pothole Region water bodies evolve geochemically as climate changes. Because wetland geochemistry in turn controls the ecology of these water bodies, this research contributes to the prediction of the impact of climate change on this important complex of ecosystems. © 2016, US Government.","Goldhaber, M.B.; McCleskey, B.B.; Mills, C.T.; Mushet, D.M.; Rover, J.","","36",2016,"Climate; Geochemistry; Kidder County; Landsat; North Dakota; Prairie Potholes; Stutsman County","","","","","","","","",""

Yet a region's total economy may be enhanced by moving away from established fence-out and cost-sharing rules. With changes in public perceptions of property rights, advances in technology, and the acquisition of new scientific information, fence rules should be expected to evolve. This paper articulates political, economic and scientific considerations in the USA that may be contemplated by citizens and elected officials for altering directives controlling livestock. To promote economic efficiency and social well-being, the paper advocates the scrutiny of existing fence-out and cost-sharing rules in a region to determine whether alternative rules should be preferred. The demise of fence-out rules in some areas in the USA and other countries could help achieve a more sustainable use of range resources.","Centner, T.J.","","27",2000,"Fence costs; Fence law; Livestock trespass; Property rights; Range management","","","","","","","","",""

Annual precipitation, annual temperature, and July and January temperatures were reconstructed by comparing fossil pollen in lake sediment with pollen in surface samples, assuming that ancient climates were similar to modern climate near analogous surface samples. In the early Holocene, most of the parks experienced colder winters, warmer summers, and lower precipitation than today. An exception is Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota where, by 8000 years ago, January temperatures were higher than today. The combination of high mean annual temperature and lower precipitation at Voyageurs resulted in a dry period between 8000 and 5000 years ago, similar to the Prairie Period in regions to the south and west. A mid-Holocene warm-dry period also occurred at other northern and central parks but was much less strongly developed. In southern parks there was no clear evidence of a mid-Holocene warm-dry period. These differences suggest that global model predictions of a warm, dry climate in the northern Great Plains under doubled atmospheric CO2 may be more applicable to Voyageurs than to the other parks. The contrast in reconstructed temperatures at Voyageurs and Isle Royale indicates that the ameliorating effect of the Great Lakes on temperatures has been in effect throughout the Holocene and presumably will continue in the future, thus reducing the potential for species loss caused by future temperature extremes. Increased numbers of mesic trees at all of the parks in the late Holocene reflect increasing annual precipitation. This trend toward more mesic conditions began 6000 years ago in the south and 4000 years ago in the north and increased sharply in recent millennia at parks located today in lake-effect snow belts. This suggests that lake-effect snowfall is sensitive to continental-scale changes in climate and could be affected by future climate change. Plant and animal species sensitive to changes in the moisture regime could thus be endangered within the Great Lakes parks.","Calcote, R.; Cole, K.L.; Davis, M.; Douglas, C.; Flakne, R.; Winkler, M.G.","","14",2000,"","","","","","","","","",""

Vegetation is primarily restricted by precipitation and temperature, whereas, most mammals are limited by both climate and vegetation (i.e., habitats). Consequently, climate change in the late Quaternary has affected the composition of mammal communities along environmental gradients. To evaluate these impacts at the biome scale, 211 late Quaternary (20,000–500 cal yr BP) mammal faunas from two modern biome regions east of the Rocky Mountains were compared using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Communities came from temperate grassland deserts (TGD) and seasonal forests (TSF). Here, we focus on overall changes in community composition and diversity, and the broader impacts along longitudinally and latitudinally structured moisture and temperature gradients, respectively. Compositional turnover of Pleistocene communities follows a broad and gradual longitudinal gradient, with moisture decreasing to the west as it does today. However, Pleistocene TSF faunas are more diverse and compositionally distinct from those of the Holocene, while TGD communities are compositionally similar throughout the late Quaternary. Clear boundaries (narrow ecotones) marking the turnover along longitude between TGD and TSF are identified in the Holocene. Across latitude, we find greater spatial turnover in the late Pleistocene, indicating that Pleistocene temperature gradients were significantly stronger than in the Holocene. We interpret these faunal differences to be consistent with greater patchiness in the Pleistocene supported by more pronounced environmental heterogeneity. Non-analog faunas may be a manifestation of stronger Pleistocene gradients, patchiness, and greater spatial community turnover. The “flickering” of the Pleistocene climate in contrast to the stability of the Holocene may have been the primary driver of these differences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Graham, R.W.; Pardi, M.I.","","530-531",2019,"Climate change; Environmental gradients; Holocene; Non-analog; Pleistocene; Temperate biomes","","","","","","","","",""

Two problems for carbon cycle explanations of this glaciation are an Hirnantian CO2 green-house estimated at 4035 ppmv from mass balance models and possibly related Hirnantian mass extinctions. This estimate of high CO2 is a 10-m.yr. average, here evaluated against high-resolution sequences of paleosols that give estimates not only of CO2 but also of paleoclimate and vegetation through the Late Ordovician. Katian paleosols of the eastern United States show increases in depth and in degree of carbon consumption and storage comparable with those preceding glaciation of the Devonian-Permian and Quaternary. Early thalloid land plants with rhizoidsmay have drawn down atmospheric CO2 to only 166 ± 83 ppmv during the Hirnantian, as estimated here from a pedogenic CO2 paleobarometer. Ordovician paleosols also reveal a short-termgreenhouse spike to as much as 4670 ppmv immediately before Hirnantian glaciation. This greenhouse spike may be due to thermogenic methane release from a large igneous province and is comparable with greenhouse spikes during other mass extinctions, such as those of the Late Permian and Late Jurassic. © 2015 by The University of Chicago.

A site-specific relationship between moisture content and electrical conductivity data was developed for the soil zone, and a perched water zone was monitored at two of the sites. Results showed that (a) change in soil moisture content was linearly correlated to change in electric conductivity in the soil zone; (b) vegetation cover type induced differences in vertical bulk electrical resistivity (ER) profiles and influenced the temporal evolution of soil moisture profiles; and (c) juniper encroachment lowered the water level in the perched groundwater aquifer.

Examples of Quaternary faunal radiation between the Nearctic and Palearctic biogeographic regions and between Beringia and the Great Plains indicate that the 'ice-free' corridor region of western Canada must have been such a route for grazing animals. Today, boreal forest and extensive peatlands in the ice-free corridor region separate the open vegetation of the grasslands and arctic tundra. However, it is likely that open vegetation existed between Beringia and the plains, creating a biogeographic corridor during some Pleistocene glacial stages and during glacial non-glacial transitions such as the Late Glacial-Early Holocene. Between 12,000 and 10,000 BP the corridor supported a herb and shrub dominated vegetation that includedPopulus trees and probably reflected a climate that was relatively warm in the summer and dry. Vertebrate paleontological evidence indicates that the corridor vegetation supported grazing fauna. The most recent closing of the biogeographic corridor occurred with the development of the present boreal forest, which is dominated by plants unsuitable for grazing. The development of forest was initiated by a rapid northward spread ofPicea glauca andP. mariana from the eastern plains and western mountains at 10,000 BP. By 8000 BP thePicea forests in the corridor were as dense as at present. The extensive peatlands that typify much of the corridor today developed by ∼5000 BP and provide an additional impediment for the movement of some grazing animals. © 1996 INQUA/Elsevier Science Ltd.

Despite the special mode of carbonate production, descriptions of the sedimentary facies are exceptional and cursory because marl prairies are so far reported only from the recent of the Everglades (Florida, USA), where they produce an unspectacular calcite mud. We present a Pleistocene Everglades-type marl prairie from coastal Tanzania as the first fossil example. The unique preservation and high productivity (two times higher than in the Everglades) of the periphyton community in this marl prairie is due to increased calcification of coccoid and filamentous cyanobacteria. The excellent preservation allows us to characterize a marl prairie facies in great detail for the first time. Facies analyses of the sediments reveal a transition from tidal to terrestrial settings that started at ca. 44 14C ka in response to eustatic sea-level fall and coastal tectonic uplift. The resultant drop of the groundwater table triggered the development of the marl prairie.

Interpretations of these isotopic trends require quantitative estimates of the influence of climatic and environmental changes on δ18O and δD of soil water. Here we use a coupled atmosphere-land model with water-isotopologue tracking capabilities, ECHAM5-JSBACH-wiso, to simulate precipitation and δ18O responses to elevation-independent changes in Neogene geography, equator to pole temperature gradient (EPGRAD), grassland expansion, and tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures. Both precipitation and soil water δ18O (δ18Osw) respond strongly to Neogene strengthening of the EPGRAD, but weakly to other forcings. An increase in EPGRAD leads to significant drying and 18O enrichment (3‰-5‰) of soil water over the northern Sierra Nevada and central Rockies as a result of Hadley circulation strengthening and enhanced coastal subtropical subsidence. These large-scale circulation changes reduce inland moisture transport from the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Our simulated δ18Osw responses could explain 50%- 100% of the proxy δ18O increases over the Sierra Nevada and central Rockies, suggesting that climate change rather than surface subsidence may have been the dominant climate signal in δ18O records in these regions. On the contrary, δ18O responses to climate changes are small in the Great Basin, indicating that the observed δ18O increase over this region was likely a direct response to surface subsidence with elevation losses of 1-1.5 km. Adding this elevation loss to current Great Basin elevations reveals the former existence of a uniformly high plateau extending from the Sierra Nevada to the central Rockies prior to Neogene extension.

There appears to be no consensus on the Prairies concerning the desirability of bilateral free trade with the United States. There is, rather, a diversity of expectations and concerns. The task of this monograph is to consider briefly those developments which have compromised this faith in free trade before turning to an examination of the expected effects of both free trade in general and the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, reached on October 4, 1987, in particular, on individual industries important to the Prairies. The study concludes that the Prairie and world economies have evolved over the past several decades in ways that remove much of the attraction of bilateral free trade for the Prairie provinces; that the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement is likely to meet few of the needs of Prairie industries; and that inherent in the Agreement are significant risks for the future development of the region. -from Author","Dorey, S.","","",1989,"","","","","","","","","",""

Paleosols are the upper part of the weathering profile and change laterally, whereas the rest of the weathering profile may not change. Hence, the simple weathering profile may not adequately explain paleo-landscapes. Paleosols may be analyzed on the basis of their physical, mineralogical, and chemical properties, but in some cases certain of these properties cannot be used where secondary enrichment has occurred. Paleosols are used principally for stratigraphie purposes, for regional correlation of Quaternary deposits and features, and for environmental interpretations of inter- or intra-glacial or -pluvial regimens. The gumbotil of the Midwest includes paleosols that are analogues of Planosols, Humic-Gley soils, Gray-Brown Podzolic soils, and Grumusols and separates glaeial stages. Geographic tracing of these paleosols is the main basis for regional correlation of Nebraskan, Kansan, and Illinoian drifts. Paleosols are the basis of correlation of events from pluvial Lake Bonneville in Utah to pluvial Lake Lahontan in Nevada and the Sierra Nevada in California. A prominent Sangamon paleosol has been used to separate the Loveland (Illinoian) loess from the overlying Wisconsin loess from the Great Plains to Ohio and down the Mississippi River Valley to near the Gulf of Mexico. In southern Iowa the surface soils were dominantly formed under prairie, whereas more than 90% of the immediately pre-Wisconsin paleosols are paleo-Gray Brown Podzolic soils formed under forest. Redder colors of Sangamon paleosols, compared to surface soils in the Midwest, suggest warmer climate and/or longer weathering in Sangamon time. In addition to color, depth of leaching of carbonates and properties of the solum of paleosols have been used to estimate duration of weathering or time between Pleistocene events.

The early inhabitants of the boreal region of British Columbia (BC) capitalized on naturally occurring wildfires and anthropogenic burning to provide forage for free-ranging horses and manage habitat for wildlife. This form of pyric herbivory, or grazing driven by fire via the attraction to the palatable vegetation in recently burned areas, is an evolutionary disturbance process that occurs globally. However, its application to manage forage availability for free-ranging horses has not been studied in northern Canada. Across Canada, there are varying levels of governance for feral and free-ranging horses depending on the provincial jurisdiction and associated legislation. The BC Range Act (Act) allows range tenure holders to free-range horses that they own for commercial operations on Crown land. Big-game guide outfitters as range tenure holders are provided grazing licences or grazing permits under the Act with an approved range use plan. Guide outfitters and other range tenure holders have incorporated fire ecology as part of their rangeland management in mountainous portions of the boreal forest of northeastern BC to promote mosaics of vegetation height and species composition across the landscape to meet nutritional requirements of their free-ranging horses. Using resource selection function models, we evaluated the influence of pyric herbivory on boreal vegetation and use by horse herds occupying 4 distinct landscapes. We found that horses preferentially selected recently burned areas and areas that burned more frequently when they were available. We also found that horses avoided steep slopes and forest cover types.

Grass and herb cover, and woody plant densities were measured on 25 native and 25 exotic grassland plots in southeastern Arizona between 1984 and 1990. At least 40 yr previously, the exotic plots had been seeded with two species of lovegrasses (Eragrostis spp.) native to southern Africa. A 1987 wildfire burned 11 native and 11 exotic plots. The fire reduced cover of both native and African grasses for two post‐fire growing seasons. Herb cover as a whole increased after the fire for 2 yr, although there were important differences among species. One of two dominant shrubs Haplopappus tenuisectus was killed by the fire, while the other Baccharis pteronioides was little affected. Mesquite trees Prosopis juliflora were killed to the ground by the fire, but 62 of 66 trees had re‐sprouted to an average 48% of pre‐burn height by 1990. Native and exotic grasses appeared equally tolerant of fire, probably because both evolved in fire‐type ecosystems. There was no evidence that fire can be used to permanently restore the diverse native flora to species‐poor plantations of the South African exotics. 1992 IAVS ‐ the International Association of Vegetation Science","Bock, C.E.; Bock, J.H.","","3",1992,"Colonizing species; Fire ecology; Great Plains","","","","","","","","",""

Wood from the sediments has a radiocarbon age of 9600 ± 200 years. The vertebrate fauna contains the tooth of a prairie dog and the remains of frog, salamander, snake, and fish - all characteristic of present-day montane lakes and ponds and their margins in Colorado. The mollusks are all living species, and the fauna is dominated by gastropods. With the exception of one form (Vitrina alaskana Dall), whose known range does not extend as far south as Huerfano Park, the fauna is not significantly different from the mollusks living in the area today. The sediments also contain an abundant and unusually diversified sponge fauna in which as many as six species may be represented. A pollen spectrum from the sediments is composed of arboreal pollen characteristic of the present-day Transition Zone flora which, in Colorado, grows on the upper edge of the Great Plains and all of the foothills belt. Vertical variation in the sediment types and the enclosed biota makes it possible to recreate the changing depositional environment and local climate throughout the life of the pond. The basal sediments, interbedded marl and clastic materials, are interpreted as indicating deposition during alternating wet and dry periods. A bed of nearly pure calcium carbonate marl, which reaches a thickness of 2 feet, forms the middle stratigraphic unit. It is highly fossiliferous and is thought to have been deposited during a warm dry period with relatively mild winters. The uppermost stratigraphic unit is a gray carbonaceous clay which filled the basin as vegetation encroached upon the lake and the lake itself was reduced to a marsh. Because of the radiocarbon age and the reconstruction of the climate based upon faunal and sedimentological changes, the lower two stratigraphic units are thought to correlate with the Lubbock Subpluvial, and the uppermost unit, the gray carbonaceous clay, with the early part of the Yellow House Interval as described in the Llano Estacado, New Mexico. © 1965, The Geological Society of America, Inc.","Kauffman, E.G.; McCulloch, D.S.","","76",1965,"","","","","","","","","",""

Spatial heterogeneity that influences prey availability might play an important role in the scales at which potential competitors select habitat. We assessed potential mechanisms for coexistence by examining the role of heterogeneity in resource partitioning between sympatric raptors overwintering in the southern Great Plains. We conducted surveys for wintering Red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and Northern Harrier (Circus cyanea) at two state wildlife management areas in Oklahoma, USA. We used information from repeated distance sampling to project use locations in a GIS. We applied resource selection functions to model habitat selection at three scales and analyzed for niche partitioning using the outlying mean index. Habitat selection of the two predators was mediated by spatial heterogeneity. The two predators demonstrated significant fine-scale discrimination in habitat selection in homogeneous landscapes, but were more sympatric in heterogeneous landscapes. Red-tailed hawk used a variety of cover types in heterogeneous landscapes but specialized on riparian forest in homogeneous landscapes. Northern Harrier specialized on upland grasslands in homogeneous landscapes but selected more cover types in heterogeneous landscapes. Our study supports the growing body of evidence that landscapes can affect animal behaviors. In the system we studied, larger patches of primary land cover types were associated with greater allopatry in habitat selection between two potentially competing predators. Heterogeneity within the scale of raptor home ranges was associated with greater sympatry in use and less specialization in land cover types selected. © 2017 The Authors.

The Washtucna Soil, formed 40,000-15,000 yr ago during the last full glacial, contains up to 90% by volume distinctive cylindrical pedotubules that are 1-2 cm in diameter formed by burrowing fauna. The overlying post-glacial loess and modern surface soils that support perennial grasslands lack these cylindrical burrows. We investigated the paleoecological significance of the burrows. Observations of several types of burrowing fauna under native vegetation indicated that nymphs of cicadas (Homoptera: Cicadidae) are responsible for cylindrical, back-filled burrows that match those in the Washtucna Soil. We measured the abundance of active cicada burrows in soils in four native vegetation zones (Soil sites), establishing that cicada burrows comprise 19% of the rooting zone volume in sagebrush steppe, but just 1-3% of the rooting zone volume in bunchgrass steppe, meadow steppe and coniferous forest. This suggests strongly that abundant cicada burrows in paleosols are a proxy for the geographic extent of plant communities that contained sagebrush. To assay the activity of cicada nymphs through time, we measured burrowed volume by depth from the soil surface down through the Washtucna Soil (i.e. from the present to ca. 40,000 yr BP) at five stratigraphic research sites (Paleosol sites). Cicada-burrowed volume is generally less than 5% in the rooting zone of the surface soils and throughout Holocene loess, but is up to 94% in the rooting zone of the Washtucna Soil at Paleosol sites that currently support bunchgrass steppe outside the present-day sagebrush steppe zone. Cicada host preferences in vegetation zones today suggest that sagebrush was the dominant shrub as the Washtucna Soil formed. From this reconstruction, combined with information from studies of pollen and plant opal, we infer that periglacial steppe plant communities dominated by sagebrush spread, from 40,000 to 15,000 yr BP, into areas of the Columbia Plateau that support bunchgrass steppe, meadow steppe, and even some coniferous forest today.

Experimental data are presented from the first Radiobrightness Energy Balance Experiment (REBEX 1) which combined continuous micrometeorological observations with ground-based measurement of terrain radiobrightnesses at Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) frequencies. The REBEX 1 site near Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is characteristic of the northern Great Plains grasslands and climate. The experiment period from October 1992 to April 1993 spanned vegetation senescence, snowpack formation and evolution, and spring thaw. Patterns in the data are analyzed using a snowpack evolution and radiobrightness model driven by REBEX 1 energy and moisture flux measurements. The snowpack model differs from most soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) schemes in the level of detail used in modeling the near-surface medium. Snowpack temperature and structural details are necessary in order to model both the microwave thermal source and snowpack interactions and the continuing metamorphism of the snow. Modeled radiobrightness variation at 19, 37, and 85 GHz agree with observations to within 29, 16, and 13% (root mean square), respectively, over a 53 day test period. Both observed and modeled radiobrightness dynamics show sensitivity to (1) unfrozen soil moisture content at 19 and 37 GHz, (2) snow grain size and sky brightness variation (primarily at 85 GHz), and (3) snowpack partial melt and refreeze cycles (all frequencies). Furthermore, we find that snowpack stratification does not drive brightness variation in these data even at 19 GHz where snowpack penetration is greatest.","England, A.W.; Galantowicz, J.F.","","102",1997,"","","","","","","","","",""

As an aid to managers in determining actions that may be successful in restoring resilience to ecosystems, we describe linkages among components that may enable managers to harness beneficial effects of disturbances while minimizing the adverse effects. A conceptual framework presented here identifies relations among factors that managers can influence, and that are important to ecological processes and outcomes.

We investigated genetic structuring using complementary individual- and population-based analyses, the latter employing a novel technique to geographically cluster individuals without introducing investigator bias. The analyses revealed genetic structuring at two distinct scales.

Second, within each region, gene flow appears to be strongly limited by distance, particularly in the presence of habitat barriers such as open desert and grasslands. Northern pumas showed both reduced genetic diversity and greater divergence from a hypothetical ancestral population based on Bayesian clustering analyses, possibly reflecting a post-Pleistocene range expansion. Bayesian clustering results were sensitive to sampling density, which may complicate inference of numbers of populations when using this method.

Currently, grassland birds have experienced ongoing population declines, following widespread implementation of intensive rangeland management practices that reduce habitat heterogeneity. Patch-burn grazing is an alternative rangeland management strategy that promotes habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity. We conducted a 3-yr. field study in the central Flint Hills of Kansas to compare the spatial ecology of female Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) in rangelands managed with intensive rangeland management versus patch-burn grazing. This is the first study on the effects of patch-burn grazing on the space use decisions of Greater Prairie-Chickens at the home range scale. We used seasonal estimates of home range for 6-mo breeding and nonbreeding periods, as well as resource utilization functions to investigate the response of female prairie chickens to landscape metrics describing fire, grazing, and proximity to anthropogenic structures or lek sites. In our analysis of all radio-marked females, distance to lek was consistently the strongest predictor of space use during both breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Females captured at properties managed with patch-burn grazing selected areas with low stocking rates and high fire frequencies, and they avoided recently burned areas. Our study provides new evidence that patch-burn grazing can improve grassland habitat for Greater Prairie-Chickens, an umbrella species in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. Patch-burn grazing created preferred habitats for female Greater Prairie-Chickens, with a relatively frequent fire return interval, a mosaic of burned and unburned patches, and a reduced stocking rate in unburned areas avoided by grazers.

Land cover and vegetation type remains one key determinant of soil moisture content that impacts air temperature, planetary boundary layer (PBL) evolution, and precipitation through soil-moisture- evapotranspiration coupling. In turn, it will affect atmospheric chemistry and air quality. This paper presents the results of a modeling study of the effect of land cover on some key L-A processes with a focus on air quality. The newly developed NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecast (NU-WRF) modeling system couples NASA's Land Information System (LIS) with the community WRF model and allows users to explore the L-A processes and feedbacks. Three commonly used satellite-derived land cover datasets-i.e., from the US Geological Survey (USGS) and University of Maryland (UMD), which are based on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-bear large differences in agriculture, forest, grassland, and urban spatial distributions in the continental United States, and thus provide an excellent case to investigate how land cover change would impact atmospheric processes and air quality. The weeklong simulations demonstrate the noticeable differences in soil moisture/temperature, latent/sensible heat flux, PBL height, wind, NO2/ozone, and PM2.5 air quality. These discrepancies can be traced to associate with the land cover properties, e.g., stomatal resistance, albedo and emissivity, and roughness characteristics.

The early Holocene record at Elk Lake was controlled by circumstances of glacial history (e.g., basin morphometry and surrounding till lithology) in combination with global warming at the end of the Pleistocene. Later, the interplay of climate change and a disintegrating ice sheet determined the character of local environments that were affected by reduction of precipitation and increased windiness during the middle Holocene. Elk Lake became more productive and clastic sediment increased to dominate the record as the forests thinned and prairie vegetation characterized the region. During this prairie period, winters may have been cold because disintegrating northern ice sheets ceased to block winter outbreaks of Arctic air. Correlations of wind-deposited materials throughout much of the eastern two-thirds of the United States suggest that drought conditions and strong winds were widespread between 8 and 4 ka. The mid- Holocene was climatically variable, however, with strong fluctuations in varve thickness at decadal, centennial, and millennial scales testifying to rapid climatic changes. Although the cause of such climatic cycles is not yet clear, correlations between 14C anomalies and varve thickness suggest that variations in solar flux and resulting magnetic storms and zonal winds may have induced strong climatic changes. A particularly strong 600 yr fluctuation to cool and wet climates that may document neoglacial conditions around 5 ka interrupted the prairie period. After 4 ka, the climate at Elk Lake was dominated by a tropical airstream during the summer, and dry arctic and Pacific airstreams during the winter. Large-scale variations ceased, although decadal and multidecadal variations in varve thickness chronicle changes similar, but not clearly correlative, to historically documented climatic episodes such as the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.","Anderson, R.Y.; Bradbury, J.P.; Dean, W.E.","","276",1993,"","","","","","","","","",""

We studied bison wallowing on a tallgrass prairie site in Oklahoma where bison were reestablished in late 1993. Bison use of existing soil depressions fitting descriptions for relict wallows located before reintroduction and bison formation of new active wallows were documented from 1993-1995. Bison avoided existing depressions, instead forming active wallows in different locations, Bulk density and soluble salt, sodium and clay content of soils in existing depressions were significantly higher than soils in active wallows or nearby reference sites. These depressions occurred primarily on shale-derived soils rich in silt and clay, whereas active wallows were formed mostly on sandy loam soils overlying sandstone. The spatial distribution and soil conditions of these depressions suggested pedogenic, rather than animal disturbance, origins. Soil sampling beneath the depressions revealed a dense clay lens located above a natric (high exchangeable sodium content) horizon, both of which were absent from soils in nearby reference sites. Natric soil horizons, known as claypans, are formed by pedologic processes common to soils derived from marine shales. Thus, these soil depressions, and possibly other 'relict' bison wallows, are not persistent soil disturbances resulting from bison wallowing, but small patches of landscape and soil heterogeneity resulting from variation in underlying geological materials.","Carter, B.J.; Coppedge, B.R.; Engle, D.M.; Fuhlendorf, S.D.; Shaw, J.H.","","142",1999,"","","","","","","","","",""

Intraspecific ploidy variation in remnant prairie populations was found for two species of grasses, Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem) and Panicum virgatum (switchgrass). Restoration seeds differed from remnants in ploidy for three species of grass, P. virgatum, Sorghastrum nutans (Indian grass), and Spartina pectinata (prairie cordgrass), and for one species of forb, Amorpha canescens (lead plant). In the case of S. pectinata, local ecotype seeds were found to consist of two different ploidy levels. Restorations in grasslands in the United States and elsewhere are likely to create mixed ploidy populations, probably resulting in lower reproductive success for the remnant population. Prevention of mixed ploidy populations will require the screening of restoration seed sources and regional surveys for ploidy variation. © 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International.","Baack, E.J.; Delaney, J.T.","","20",2012,"Asteraceae; C-value; Genome size; Grassland; Local ecotype; Poaceae; Polyploidy","","","","","","","","",""

Ambrosia, Artemisia, Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthaceae, other Asteraceae and Cyperaceae are taxa that define prairie in the pollen record. A transect of four sites from western Iowa to eastern Illinois shows that where only one or two of these taxa reach high pollen percentages, or where all show modest increases, interpretation is difficult. Plant macrofossils from sediment exposed in stream cutbanks provide a way of refining prairie reconstructions. These sediments are deposited in point bars or behind beaver dams and have yielded a rich Holocene record of prairie species.

The initial lake was shallow. Vegetation of the region was treeless and no doubt reflected the unique late-glacial pioneering environment. Planktonic diatoms characteristic of a deep, eutrophic lake were dominant by ca. 11400 yr B.P., when a birch-spruce-dominated Boreal Forest developed. However, in response to early Holocene warmth and aridity the lake had become saline by ca. 10,000 yr B.P. when Chaetoceros spp. and Cyclotella caspia became dominant, while an open parkland/grassland vegetation had developed, subject to increased fire frequency. Freshwater taxa reappeared between ca. 9100 and ca. 8400 yr B.P. providing evidence of a wetter period. However, after ca. 8400 yr B.P. planktonic saline taxa returned as dominants. By ca. 6200 yr B.P. birch spruce forests were once again developed in the area in response to more effective precipitation. Between ca. 5800 and 4000 yr B.P. oscillations between fresh and saline diatom taxa occurred suggesting some aridtry reversals. During the last ca. 4000 years planktonic eutrophic diatom taxa dominated. Diatom numbers were initially low but increased ca. 11,400 yr B.P. and remained high until ca. 10,000 yr B.P. They were minimal during the saline interval. Afterwards as the lake freshened numbers of diatoms increased and several large peaks occurred, perhaps in response to internal nutrient loading coupled with increased runoff and erosion. Oscillaxanthin concentrations were initially high, but during the saline interval they became undetectable, except during the freshwater interlude, and then, as the lake became fresh large maxima occurred. In contrast, myxoxanthophyll concentrations were high during this saline interval. Large myxoxanthophyll peaks occurred simultaneously with those of oscillaxanthin as the lake freshened. Overall lake palaeoproduction levels during the Holocene appear to have altered little. The Moore Lake record demonstrates short-lived palaeoclimatic changes of unknown cause superimposed upon the broad trends, and the value of the palaeolimnological record which can be much more sensitive than fossil pollen vegetation reconstruction in demonstrating climate history.

Although climate change affects terrestrial N cycling with important feedbacks to plant productivity and carbon sequestration, the impacts of climate change on the relative availability of N with respect to P remain highly uncertain. In a semiarid grassland in Wyoming, USA, we studied the effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment (to 600 ppmv) and warming (1.5/3.0°C above ambient temperature during the day/night) on plant, microbial and available soil pools of N and P. Elevated CO2 increased P availability to plants and microbes relative to that of N, whereas warming reduced P availability relative to N. Across years and treatments, plant N : P ratios varied between 5 and 18 and were inversely related to soil moisture. Our results indicate that soil moisture is important in controlling P supply from inorganic sources, causing reduced P relative to N availability during dry periods. Both wetter soil conditions under elevated CO2 and drier conditions with warming can further alter N : P.

The long-lived, heavy rainfall event was a result of complex interplays between topographic, synoptic, and convective processes that rendered an accurate simulation of this event a challenging task. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model was used to simulate this event and was validated against several observation datasets. Both the timing and location of the model precipitation agree closely with the observations, indicating that the WRF Model is capable of reproducing this type of severe event. Sensitivity tests with different microphysics schemes were conducted and evaluated using equitable threat and bias frequency scores. The WRF double-moment 6-class microphysics scheme (WDM6) generally performed better when compared with other schemes. The application of a conventional convective/stratiform separation algorithm shows that convective activity was dominant during the early stages, then evolved into predominantly stratiform precipitation later in the event. The HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis and regional water budget assessments using WRF simulation output suggest that the moisture for the precipitation was mainly from recycling antecedent soil moisture through evaporation and evapotranspiration over the Canadian Prairies and the U.S. Great Plains.

Here, we evaluated the fitness costs of EPSPS amplification in kochia by comparing susceptible and resistant full siblings from segregating F2 populations generated from within six populations.

Under competitive greenhouse conditions, the EPSPS type of the line's maternal parent showed persistent effects: delayed emergence, delayed flowering, and reductions in viable seed count and weight overall. High EPSPS copy number individuals had reduced seed count and weight, reduced competitive ability, and reduced final height in mixed stands, but better germination of the F3. However, all characteristics were highly variable and fitness costs were not constant across genetic backgrounds. In the absence of selection from glyphosate, kochia with increased EPSPS copy number will be at a competitive disadvantage in some genetic backgrounds. © 2017","Beckie, H.J.; Benedict, L.; Hall, L.M.; Martin, S.L.; Sauder, C.A.; Wei, W.; da Costa, L.O.","","261",2017,"5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS); Competitive fitness experiment; F2 segregating population; Gene amplification; Glyphosate resistance; Herbicide resistance; Kochia scoparia","","","","","","","","",""

South Texas is a semiarid and subtropical environment with highly variable weather, a land base consisting of large private ranches devoted to livestock production, a perennial problem of brush encroachment on rangelands, and a strong tradition of fee-lease hunting. These physical, biotic, and social conditions focused research efforts on descriptive natural history (ca. 1930-1980) and evaluation of grazing and brush management practices (ca. 1980-1990). By natural evolution of knowledge, these efforts led to the development of unified theory that synthesized descriptive anti applied information about bobwhite management (ca. 1990-2000). In the context of grazing on rangeland subject to encroachment by woody plants, descriptive studies focused on bobwhite home ranges, mobility, flight behavior, nesting cover, resting cover, and whistling posts, among other aspects of habitat use and behavior. The purpose of these studies was to determine how different plant structures and communities should be dispersed in space and time to maximize their value as bobwhite habitat. South Texas studies revealed that the dogmatic principle, ""bobwhites are early successional species,"" holds poorly in semiarid, subtropical environments. Research in south Texas led to formalization of the usable-space-in-time hypothesis on bobwhite density. The hypothesis states that, within ordinary limits, mean abundance of bobwhites on an area is correlated more strongly with the quantity of permanent cover to which they are adapted and less strongly with (human) perceptions of habitat quality (foods, interspersion, edge, diversity). Space-time seems to be an omnibus variable that can be assessed in a variety of management and ecological settings. In association with highly variable rainfall patterns anti amounts in south Texas, bobwhite populations exhibit boom-bust population behavior. Research on the cause-effect process governing booms anti busts has led to rejection of hypotheses on phosphorus, calcium, phytoestrogens, vitamin A, macronutrition, water, and stress-related hormones as causally involved in the phenomenon. Heat-mediated variation in productivity remains a viable hypothesis that is, of course, open to challenge. The information legacy from research on bobwhites in south Texas has led to revision of knowledge emanating from the southeastern United States; the revised knowledge better fits bobwhites and other quails that inhabit semiarid environments.","Guthery, F.S.; Hernández, F.; Kuvlesky Jr., W.P.","","66",2002,"Boom-bust population dynamics; Colinus virginianus; Grazing; Heat stress; Northern bobwhite; Phosphorus deficiency; Population dynamics; Texas; Vitamin A; Water deprivation","","","","","","","","",""

However, many modeling efforts ignore the dynamic processes that drive distributional patterns at different scales, which may result in misleading inference about the factors influencing species distributions. Current occupancy models allow estimation of occupancy at different scales and, separately, estimation of immigration and emigration. However, joint estimation of local extinction, colonization, and occupancy within a multi-scale model is currently unpublished. We extended multi-scale models to account for the dynamic processes governing species distributions, while concurrently modeling local-scale availability. We fit the model to data for lark buntings and chestnut-collared longspurs in the Great Plains, USA, collected under the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions program. We investigate how the amount of grassland and shrubland and annual vegetation conditions affect bird occupancy dynamics and local vegetation structure affects fine-scale occupancy. Buntings were prevalent and longspurs rare in our study area, but both species were locally prevalent when present. Buntings colonized sites with preferred habitat configurations, longspurs colonized a wider range of landscape conditions, and site persistence of both was higher at sites with greener vegetation. Turnover rates were high for both species, quantifying the nomadic behavior of the species. Our model allows researchers to jointly investigate temporal dynamics of species distributions and hierarchical habitat use. Our results indicate that grassland birds respond to different covariates at landscape and local scales suggesting different conservation goals at each scale. High turnover rates of these species highlight the need to account for the dynamics of nomadic species, and our model can help inform how to coordinate management efforts to provide appropriate habitat configurations at the landscape scale and provide habitat targets for local managers. © 2018 The Authors.

It is therefore important to understand the duration of such events, as well as their severity and consequences beyond the century-scale instrumental record. The existing drought records can be complemented with additional proxies that clearly document the interactions between external factors and the depositional environment. Here we attempt to reconstruct the last millennium drought history of Deming Lake, a small lake at Minnesota's prairie-forest ecotone, using sediment magnetism. In particular, this approach allowed us to explore the interactions between lake and catchment, and test the hypothesis that periods of moderate aridity result in decreased hydrologic sediment transport from the catchment to the lake, as a consequence of reduced erosion and overland flow. Concordantly, during dry episodes we find that the mass fractions of in-lake produced organic matter and biogenic magnetic particles increase relative to allochthonous component fractions. We identify several episodes of aridity at Deming Lake consistent with existing regional drought reconstructions.

Self-organization to the critical state is manifested by scale-free behavior across many orders of magnitude (Bak et al. 1987, Bak 1996, Solé et al. 1999). Spatial scale-free behavior implies fractal properties and is quantified by the fractal dimension. Temporal scale-free behavior is evident in power spectra of fluctuations that obey power laws. Self-organized criticality is a universal phenomenon that likely produces some of the fractals and power laws observed in nature. We investigated the historical landscape of southern Wisconsin (USA) (60,000 km2) for self-organization and complexity. The landscape is patterned into prairies, savannas, and open and closed forests, using data from the United States General Land Office Surveys that were conducted during the 19th century, at a time prior to Euro-American settlement. We applied a two-dimensional cellular automaton model with one adjustable parameter. Model evolution replaces a cell that dies at random times by a cell chosen randomly from within a circular radius r, where r typically takes values between 1 (local) and 10 units (regional). Cluster probability is used to measure the degree of organization. The model landscape self-organizes to a realistic critical state if neighborhoods of intermediate size (r = 3) are chosen, indicating that (a) no particular time or space scale for the clusters is singled out, i.e. the spatial dependence is fractal, and temporal fluctuations in the cluster probability exhibit power laws; (b) a simple model suffices to replicate the landscape pattern resulting from complex spatial and temporal interactions. Measures of comparison between the observed and the simulated landscape show good agreement: fractal dimensions for simulated (1.6) and observed landscapes (1.64), cluster probabilities for simulated (32.3%) and observed (32.6%) landscapes, and algorithmic complexity for simulated (6792 bytes) and observed (6205 bytes) landscapes.

Most of these lakes are ephemeral, filling with water during the spring and drying completely by late summer. Ceylon Lake, located in southern Saskatchewan, is typical of many of these shallow ephemeral lacustrine basins. The stratigraphic sequence recovered from this salt playa can be subdivided into six distinct facies types: (a) icelaid gravelly clay loam diamicton; (b) fluvial massive bedded to laminated sand; (c) lacustrine laminated calcareous clay and silt; (d) lacustrine laminated gypsiferous clay and silt; (e) lacustrine black, anoxic, nonlaminated, organic-rich mud; and (f) lacustrine salt. The crystalline salt facies, which can be up to 9 meters thick, is comprised mainly of sodium and sodium + magnesium sulfates, with smaller and more variable proportions of other sulfates, halides, carbonates, and insoluble clastic detritus. Although a variety of postdepositional processes have significantly altered the nature and stratigraphic relationships in the basin, the sediment fill does record, in a general way, the fluctuating depositional, hydrological, and geochemical conditions that existed in the basin since deglaciation. The Ceylon Lake basin originated about 15 000 years ago as meltwater from the retreating glacial ice cut a major spillway system in the drift and bedrock. The initial (early Holocene) phases of lacustrine sedimentation in Ceylon Lake occurred in a relatively deep freshwater lake. By about 6000 years B.P., the lake had become much shallower with numerous episodes of complete drying and subaerial exposure. The most recent 5000 years of deposition in the basin have been dominated by evaporite sedimentation.

The paleorecord of ACL suggests increased drought frequency and a lower TWI elevation from 2555-1323 cal yr B.P. and 606-334 cal yr B.P. Charcoal began to accumulate and a novel fire regime was initiated ca. 880 cal yr B.P., followed by a decreased fire return interval at ca. 550 cal yr B.P.

The record of those seas is documented by Late Cambrian to Middle Ordovician formations. These are, in ascending order, the Mt.

In the central Michigan Basin, however, deposition of the Sauk sequence was continuous and the post-Sauk unconformity was not developed.

However, all three cultivars were developed under New Zealand conditions and may not have sufficient winter hardiness to survive northeastern USA winters. Growth chamber and field studies were conducted to determine the freezing tolerance and winter survival of these new forages under well-watered and drought conditions. Winter survival of chicory in the field ranged from 73% of marked plants in the wet treatment to 93% following summer drought. Likewise, winter survival of plantain in the field increased from 3% in the wet treatment to 41% in the dry treatment. Survival of Lancelot plantain in the growth chamber increased from 4% in the well-watered to 16% in the drought treatment. However, survival of Tonic plantain and Puna chicory in the growth chamber was not affected by drought. Chicory survival was greater than survival of plantain in both controlled and field environments. Puna chicory appears to have sufficient winter hardiness to survive winters in the northeastern United States.

Here, we apply optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, mainly on silt-sized quartz from Prairie Complex strata. In total, 27 OSL ages indicate that the Prairie Complex consists of multiple allostratigraphic units that formed mainly during marine isotope stages 7, 5e, and 5a. Thus, the aggradation of the Prairie Complex is strongly correlated with the sea-level highstands of the last two glacialinterglacial cycles. Fluvial incision during the sea-level fall associated with the MIS 5a-MIS 4 transition extended as far inland as ~600km from the present-day shoreline, testifying to the dominant downstream control of fluvial stratigraphic architecture in the Lower Mississippi Valley. In addition, the short reaction time of the Lower Mississippi River suggests that large fluvial systems can respond much more rapidly to allogenic forcing than is commonly believed. © 2012 Geological Society of America.","Autin, W.J.; Mateo, Z.R.P.; Mauz, B.; Shen, Z.; Straub, K.M.; Törnqvist, T.E.","","124",2012,"","","","","","","","","",""

Besides climatic conditions, it depends on several factors, among them, land uses, the rooting and water table depths, and the presence of soil heterogeneities (e.g., petrocalcic horizons). In the present work, PAW evolution was assessed over 441 days in a vertical 1D domain of a monitored Pampean petrocalcic soil under two different land uses and contrasted water demand (i.e., natural and afforested grasslands). For this purpose, rooting depths were estimated using a process-based numerical model of the aquifer-soil-plant-atmosphere continuum constrained by both in situ measured atmospheric demand and water table fluctuations. This model was calibrated against soil water content measurements at different depths and finally, as validation, computed transpiration rates were compared with the sap flow measurements. Modeling results, and calibrated rooting depths, suggest that petrocalcic horizons induce a limited hydraulic connection between the shallow soil portions and the phreatic aquifer. Thus, water storage is enhanced above the petrocalcic horizon in the natural grassland plot particularly during the periods of low atmospheric demand, whereas it is immediately consumed by forest to soil wilting point below the afforested grassland (hydric stress). The numerical methodology followed here appears as an alternative to estimate the forest groundwater usage in afforested grasslands, a key issue in soil salinization research in great plain areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bea, S.A.; Mujica, C.R.","","361",2020,"Changes in land uses; PAW (plant-available water); Petrocalcic horizons; Rooting depths estimation; Soil salinization","","","","","","","","",""

The primary motivation has been to design a land model for use in the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) cloud-resolving model to study land-atmosphere interactions with a sufficient level of realism. SLM uses simplified expressions for the transport of heat, moisture, momentum, and radiation in soil-vegetation system. The SLM performance has been evaluated over several land surface types using summertime tower observations of micrometeorological and biophysical data from three AmeriFlux sites, which include grassland, cropland, and deciduous-broadleaf forest. In general, the SLM captures the observed diurnal cycle of surface energy budget and soil temperature reasonably well, although reproducing the evolution of soil moisture, especially after rain events, has been challenging. The SLM coupled to SAM has been applied to the case of summertime shallow cumulus convection over land based on the Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) Southern Great Plain (SGP) observations. The simulated surface latent and sensible heat fluxes as well as the evolution of thermodynamic profiles in convective boundary layer agree well with the estimates based on the observations. Sensitivity of atmospheric boundary layer development to the soil moisture and different land cover types has been also examined. © 2015.

Less studied and analysed are the actual vegetation dynamics as result of their isolated location, small extension, and numerous and frequent disturbances (pedoturbation caused by mammals, fire and invasive species). With, detailed soil, vegetation and faunistic field survey we attempted to describe the most relevant actual processes of these very valuable grassland fragments from conservational point of view. Vegetation were sampled in 28 1×1 m quadrats, ordered in transects by distance from the edge. Presence of 104 higher plant species and a significant edge effect in the outlying sections (until 3 m) were established. It could be characterized by a significant lower naturalness value, different plant composition, presence of weed and ruderal species such as Arctium lappa, Artemisia vulgaris, Atriplex patala since most of specialists (Salvia pratensis, Pulsatilla spp., Inula hirta, Aster amellus, Dianthus pontederae) were absent in the edge.

Plant oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) enhance the duration and depth of mammalian torpor. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that black-tailed prairie dogs sampled in the field have less PUFAs in their diets and that the enhancement of torpor bouts by this species on a diet higher in PUFA is less profound than that by white-tailed prairie dogs. Individuals of both species fed a high PUFA diet: (1) entered torpor earlier, (2) had lower torpor body temperatures and (3) had longer bouts of torpor, compared to those on a low PUFA diet. However, the magnitude of this change was similar for both species. Additionally, the PUFA compositions of white adipose tissue (WAT) samples taken from individuals in the field were identical, indicating that diet PUFA contents for these two species were also equivalent. Therefore, while high PUFA diets can enhance hibernation by these species, it does not appear to explain the differences between spontaneous and facultative strategies. The rate of lipid peroxidation during torpor, however, was significantly higher in the WAT from white-tailed prairie dogs. Ancestral prairie dog species are spontaneous hibernators. Natural selection may have favored shallow, facultative hibernation with lower lipid peroxidation rates in the black-tailed prairie dogs as they radiated from the Rocky Mountains into the Great Plains.","Frank, C.L.; Harlow, H.J.","","171",2001,"Fatty acid saturation; Hibernation; Lipid peroxides; Prairie dogs","","","","","","","","",""

The geology of the site consists of repeating couplets of shale and limestone mantled by Pleistocene loess, on which most soils are built. The headwater stream that is the subject of this study is intermittent and well connected to the secondary porosity in the limestone aquifers, such that the water chemistry is groundwater-dominated. Despite increasing in situ weathering rates shown by increasing solute concentrations, long-term (~21 of 24 years) decline in stream-water discharge has reduced chemical denudation. The current chemical denudation rate is 0.02 mm yr−1. Limestone bedrock thickness (~26.6 m) is 38% of total bedrock thickness (~70 m); the present landscape would have taken 1–4 million years to dissolve at current weathering rates. Despite paleogeographic reconstructions suggesting exposure for the past 260 Ma, estimates of the time to erode younger strata using current physical and chemical denudation rates are 80–159 Ma, still much less than the age of the rocks.

The purpose of this study was to identify regional diversity, gene pools, and centers-of-diversity of switchgrass to gain an understanding of its post-glacial evolution and to identify both the geographic range and potential overlap between functional gene pools. We sampled a total of 384 genotypes from 49 accessions that included the three main taxonomic groups of switchgrass (lowland 4x, upland 4x, and upland 8x) along with one accession possessing an intermediate phenotype. We identified primary centers of diversity for switchgrass in the eastern and western Gulf Coast regions. Migration, drift, and selection have led to adaptive radiation in switchgrass, creating regional gene pools within each of the main taxa. We estimate that both upland-lowland divergence and 4x-to-8x polyploidization within switchgrass began approximately 1.5-1 M ybp and that subsequent ice age cycles have resulted in gene flow between ecotype lineages and between ploidy levels.

We investigated the degree to which habitat degradation and habitat loss impacted the breeding ecology of Greater Prairie-Chickens at 3 study sites across relatively intact grasslands in Kansas, USA. Across all 3 study systems, we found similar rates of multiple mating by females at 14-20% of broods. In addition, we found evidence for facultative nest parasitism of conspecific females. Prairie-chicken females inhabiting more intact and less fragmented landscapes with a higher probability of survival did not engage in parasitic egg laying, whereas ∼17% of females inhabiting a more fragmented and isolated landscape engaged in parasitic egg laying. Parasitic egg layers tended to be older females that parasitized nests of yearling females. Parasitic egg layers only laid parasitically after an initial nesting attempt failed. Parasitic laying females all renested and hatched their own clutches. When counting parasitically laid eggs, parasitic egg-laying females laid significantly more eggs than nonparasitic egg layers and, as a result, had 25% greater fecundity. This case study across the relatively intact grasslands of Kansas highlights how land use and management can influence adaptive life history traits and population stability. Consequently, understanding these relationships will be essential to developing effective future conservation and management plans for prairie-grouse. © 2018 Wilson Ornithological Society.

Modern calibration studies suggest that paleoclimatic interpretation of leaf wax δD values requires consideration of the differences in the apparent fractionation of hydrogen isotopes among different groups of plants. However, it is not common that paleoecological data are used to help interpret leaf wax δD profiles. Here we assess the relative importance of factors influencing millennial-scale shifts in δD values of n-alkanoic acids at Steel Lake (Minnesota, USA), an extensively studied site with independent records of vegetation composition, δD of input water to the lake, and evaporation. The δD values of the n-C28 alkanoic acid (δDC28) vary between -190 and -168‰, and do not correlate with δD of input water or the extent of evaporation. However, δDC28 is negatively correlated with the δ13C values of the n-C28 alkanoic acid (δ13CC28). The correlation, along with pollen assemblage and carbonate δ13C records, suggests that Holocene shifts between forest and grassland and/or in the water use efficiency of C3 plants influenced the stratigraphic variation in leaf wax δD. Thus, paleoecological information, such as that inferred from pollen assemblages and carbon isotopes of plant-derived compounds, may aid paleoclimatic interpretation of leaf wax δD profiles from lake sediments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Henderson, A.K.; Hu, F.S.; Huang, Y.; Nelson, D.M.","","56",2013,"","","","","","","","","",""

We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from both the control region and the ND2 gene to study the phylogenetic relationships and phylogeography of the 3 bobwhite species. We developed ecological niche models to evaluate conclusions inferred from genetic data. Colinus was composed of 2 deeply divergent lineages, 1 represented by the crested bobwhite and the other by northern and black-throated bobwhites, both of which were genetically distinct from each other. Although the northern bobwhite had high haplotype diversity, this species exhibited evidence of past demographic and geographic expansion, no phylogeographic structure, and no congruence between genetic variation and subspecies taxonomy. Ecological niche modeling was congruent with a recent range expansion for the northern bobwhite from Late Pleistocene refugia in México and the southern United States. The black-throated bobwhites from the Yucatán Peninsula were distinct from those in Nicaragua, and as a whole this species displayed little evidence of recent expansion. Ecological niche modeling suggested that the current, fragmented distribution of the black-throated bobwhite has existed for the past 130,000 years. Although the crested bobwhite displayed little evidence of population expansion, the mtDNA data revealed 3-4 geographically and genetically distinct lineages. Results of niche modeling suggest that the crested bobwhite had a much wider distribution in Central and South America during the Last Glacial Maximum.

We measured the diversity, richness, and abundance of the bee communities of five hill prairies located in northeastern Iowa and we compared these to values for large prairie preserves in northwestern Iowa, using a Monte Carlo resampling approach to standardize sampling effort between habitat types. We also measured the diversity and richness of the flowering forb communities at the hill prairies and we quantified percentage of the landscape at a 1 km radius in different landscape elements. Bee diversity at the five hill prairies spanned the range of diversity values for large prairies preserves, so although the hill prairies are small (<5 ha), their bee communities are not uniformly depauparate compared to larger western prairie preserves. Bee diversity was significantly related to flowering forb diversity, and may have been influenced by landscape features within 1 km-particularly the percentage of agricultural row crops and open water, which may negatively affect bee diversity at the sites. Iowa's hill prairie bee communities were largely composed of widespread eastern species, although about 10% of the bee species have more northern or western ranges and appear to be taking advantage of the region's unique habitat features.

Small fossils were recovered from the sedimentary deposits by washing and screening large quantities of matrix. Most of these fossils were identified by comparing them with Recent skeletal remains of the same species. Remains of larger, extinct mammals also were found. Mapping of the geology was facilitated by the use of aerial photographs, topographic maps, and Brunton compass. The basin under study is called the Butler Spring Basin and is located in southern Meade County, Kansas, about 1 mile north of the Cimarron River. It is approximately 1 mile in diameter and is believed to have formed when subsurface solution of salt and anhydrite from Permian beds caused the collapse of overlying beds of Pleistocene age. Studies of fossils preserved in the sediments filling the basin have demonstrated the presence of four superimposed vertebrate faunas. Associated with some of these faunas are mollusks, freshwater ostracods, and pollen. The oldest fauna occurs in stream deposits of the ancestral Cimarron River which lie topographically below the High Plains surface and which represent a period of downcutting during late Pleistocene time. Younger faunas occur in a series of overlying silts and sands of sinkhole origin. On the basis of stratigraphic position, faunal composition, and associated floral (pollen) evidence, the faunas are assigned to the third (Illinoian) and fourth (Wisconsin) glacials and the intervening third (Sangamon) interglacial. The Adams local fauna (Illinoian) contains fragmentary remains of large mammals taken from sands and gravels of the ancestral Cimarron River. In the Butler Spring local fauna (late Illinoian), the occurrence of Sorex cinereus, masked shrew; Citellus richardsoni, Richardson ground squirrel; and Microtus pennsylvanicus, meadow vole, whose present ranges do not extend as far south as Meade County, Kansas, suggests summers that were cooler and more moist than those in the area today. The Cragin Quarry local fauna (Sangamon) o c c u r s in sediments which overlie the Butler Spring local fauna. It includes a large and diverse mammalian assemblage; many of the species are upland prairie forms. The remains of the tortoises Gopherus and Geochelone indicate a warm, interglacial climate. A massive caliche immediately above the faunal zone suggests a period of prolonged weathering and aridity-perhaps during middle Sangamon time. The Robert local fauna (late Wisconsin) consists of microvertebrates collected from a 1 -foot, dark-gray to black silt or soil zone just below the surface in the immediate vicinity of Butler Spring. Most of the mammals are characteristic of marshy conditions or moist, low meadows. A radiocarbon date of 11,000 390 years B.P. was obtained by dating shells of Succinea ovalis Say. Several of the mammalian species represented in the fauna are not found as far south as Meade County, Kansas, at the present time. Eleven of the extant species may be found living today in northeastern South Dakota. From a study of temperature and effective precipitation in both areas, it appears that the Robert local fauna lived in Meade County, Kansas, during the late Wisconsin glacial in a climate which had cooler summers and more effective moisture than occur in the area today, and that this climate is probably similar to that of northeastern South Dakota today.","Schultz, G.E.","","105",1969,"","","","","","","","","",""

Under soil moisture stress, stomatal conductance usually decreases more than net photosynthesis, resulting in lower ratios of internal to atmospheric CO2 concentrations and higher photosynthetic water-use efficiency. However, we found that shrubs of a semiarid grassland employed opportunistic water-use strategies, which likely evolved due to the short duration of soil moisture availability. We measured photosynthetic gas exchange, leaf reflectance, and foliar stable carbon isotope composition in Artemisia cana, Prunus virginiana, Rhus trilobata, and Ribes aureum in southern Alberta. Under moist conditions, net photosynthesis was very high in A. cana, R. trilobata, and R. aureum, but less so in P. virginiana. Declining volumetric soil moisture caused stomatal conductance to decrease in proportion with net photosynthesis in 3 of 4 species (P. virginiana, R. aureum, and R. trilobata). Consequently, ratios of internal to atmospheric CO2 were unaffected by soil moisture depletion, and photosynthetic water-use efficiency declined. At the leaf level, the normalized difference vegetation index did not vary with season in these species, while the chlorophyll index decreased only slightly and the photochemical reflectance index showed a small mid-season peak. A. cana had the lowest stable carbon isotope ratio, highest stomatal conductance, highest late-season net photosynthesis, and highest leaf nitrogen (% dry weight). As soil moisture decreased, A. cana exhibited a decline in ratios of internal to atmospheric CO2 concentrations but no change in photosynthetic water-use efficiency. This study shows that even long-lived, woody species of a semiarid grassland have evolved traits facilitating rapid water-use to maximize carbon gain during brief periods of soil moisture availability.","Flanagan, L.B.; Johnson, D.R.E.; Letts, M.G.; Van Gaalen, K.E.","","16",2009,"Alberta; Great Plains; Leaf trait; Photochemical reflectance index; Stable carbon isotope; Water-use efficiency","","","","","","","","",""

Later, the interplay of climate change and a disintegrating ice sheet determined the character of local environments that were affected by reduction of precipitation and increased windiness during the middle Holocene. Elk Lake became more productive and clastic sediment increased to dominate the record as the forests thinned and prairie vegetation characterized the region. During this prairie period, winters may have been cold because disintegrating northern ice sheets ceased to block winter outbreaks of Arctic air. After 4 ka, the climate at Elk Lake was dominated by a tropical airstream during the summer, and dry arctic and Pacific air-streams during the winter. Large-scale variations ceased, although decadal and multi-decadal variations in varve thickness chronicle changes similar, but not clearly correlative, to historically documented climatic episodes such as the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. -from Authors","Anderson, R.Y.; Bradbury, J.P.; Dean, W.E.","","",1993,"","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicate the following: 1) with the proper adjustment of vegetation parameters, land-use type, fractional vegetation coverage, and soil moisture, the numerical simulations were able to capture the overall patterns measured near the surface across a growing wheat belt during benign springtime conditions in Oklahoma; 2) the impacts of the mesoscale belt of growing wheat included increased values of latent heat flux and decreased values of sensible heat flux over the wheat, increased values of atmospheric moisture near the surface above and downstream of the wheat, and a shallower planetary boundary layer (PBL) above and downstream of the wheat; 3) in the sheared environments that were examined, a shallower PBL that resulted from growing wheat (rather than natural vegetation) led to reduced entrainment of higher momentum air into the PBL and, thus, weaker winds within the PBL over and downwind from the growing wheat; 4) for the cases studied, gradients in sensible heat were insufficient to establish an unambiguous vegetation breeze or its corresponding mesoscale circulation; 5) the initialization of soil moisture within the root zone aided latent heat fluxes from growing vegetation; and 6) reasonable specification of land surface parameters was required for the correct simulation and prediction of surface heat fluxes and resulting boundary layer development. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.","McPherson, R.A.; Stensrud, D.J.","","133",2005,"","","","","","","","","",""

Beyond the changing climate, explanations for these more recent vegetation alterations are diverse and include a myriad of human influences: the introduction of livestock (cattle, sheep, and horses), homesteading, cultivation, mining, introduction of invasive species, forage seeding programs, water diversion, elevated CO2 levels, changing fire frequencies, and recreation. These causes have had overlapping, interactive, and cumulative effects upon the landscapes of the Great Basin. This paper offers a survey of some of the most widespread historical land uses in the Great Basin since European settlement and how they may have altered natural plant communities and subsequently mammal habitats. By highlighting the nature, intensity, and extent of historical practices, this paper illustrates the need to consider a broad set of land-use legacies when defining wildlife-habitat associations at local and landscape scales. Further, it points to the need for more integrated efforts that combine historical ecology with wildlife ecology and management to address current knowledge gaps and guide effective conservation and restoration recommendations. © 2014 American Society of Mammalogists.","Morris, L.R.; Rowe, R.J.","","95",2014,"historical ecology; land-use legacies; pinyon-juniper woodlands; rangeland seeding; sagebrush","","","","","","","","",""

These MTEs possess the highest levels of plant species richness in the world outside of the wet tropics. These ecosystems include a variety of vegetation structures that range from the iconic mediterranean-type shrublands to deciduous and evergreen woodlands, evergreen forests, and herblands and grasslands. Sclerophyll vegetation similar to today's mediterranean-type shrublands was already present on oligotrophic soils in the wet and humid climate of the Cretaceous, with fire-adapted Paleogene lineages in southwestern Australia and the Cape Region. The novel mediterranean-type climate (MTC) seasonality present since the middle Miocene has allowed colonization of MTEs from a regional species pool with associated diversification. Fire persistence has been a primary driving factor for speciation in four of the five regions. Understanding the regional patterns of plant species diversity among the MTEs involves complex interactions of geologic and climatic histories for each region as well as ecological factors that have promoted diversification in the Neogene and Quaternary. A critical element of species richness for many MTE lineages has been their ability to speciate and persist at fine spatial scales, with low rates of extinction. © 2016 by Annual Reviews.

Our model is based on records from four lakes and incorporates the effects of erosion, dust deposition, and the authigenesis and diagenesis of the magnetic component of the sediment. Once checked against high resolution multi proxy climate records, which are currently being established for some of our study sites, it will allow us to use magnetic proxies to establish high-resolution climate reconstructions on a regional scale. Our model utilizes a combination of concentration-dependent parameters (magnetic susceptibility, IRM) and grain-size-dependent parameters (ARM/IRM, hysteresis parameters). Magnetic mineralogy is characterized by a combination of low-temperature measurements and S-ratios, and our magnetic measurements are complemented by XRD, LOI and smearslide analyses. During periods of forest growth within the watershed, deposition of terrigenous material is low and the sediment magnetic properties are characterized by low concentrations of mainly authigenic minerals (low values of IRM, high ratios of ARM/IRM). During the early to mid-Holocene dry period, deposition of terrigenous material increased due to intensified dust deposition and the erosion of lake margins caused by lowered water levels. Concentration of magnetic minerals increases (high IRM, χ) and so does the grain-size of the magnetic fraction (low ARM/IRM). During the late Holocene, sediment magnetic properties depend on the varied position of the site with respect to the prairie-forest ecotone.","Banerjee, S.K.; Camill, P.; Geiss, C.E.; Umbanhowar, C.E.","","30",2003,"","","","","","","","","",""

Locally as much as 110 m of eolian sediments with numerous paleosols are preserved in the Quaternary Blackwater Draw Formation and the upper part of the Miocene-Pliocene Ogallala Formation. These sediments and paleosols, which cover more than 130,000 km 2, are similar to recent surface sediments and soils and record a long period of episodic eolian transport and sedimentation, and pedogenesis on a stable low-relief grass-covered landscape. Eolian sections, which comprise the fine sand to coarse silt lithofacies of the Ogallala Formation, and the very fine to fine sand and sandy mud lithofacies of the Blackwater Draw Formation, generally lack primary sedimentary structures. Grain size of Ogallala sediments decreases from west to east, and grain size of Blackwater Draw sediments decreases from southwest to northeast. Soil horizonation is well developed in most sections, and buried calcic and argillic horizons are common. Calcic horizons are characterized by sharply increased CaCO 3 content in the form of filaments, nodules, and petrocalcic horizons (calcretes). Argillic horizons are characterized by increased illuvial clay, pedogenic structure, and darker reddish hues. Rhizocretions are common locally. Open root tubules, which are typically less than 1 mm in diameter and characteristic of small plants like grasses, are present in all Ogallala and Blackwater Draw eolian sediments. Paleosols preserved in eolian sediments of the High Plains reflect periods of sedimentation followed by episodes of landscape stability and pedogenesis, and negligible sedimentation. Episodes of sedimentation and soil development likely resulted from cyclic decreases and increases in available moisture and vegetative cover. Eolian sediments were eroded and transported eastward during dry periods when vegetation was sparse in source areas, such as the western High Plains and the Pecos Valley. During humid periods more abundant vegetation probably protected source areas from deflation, and resulted in landscape stability across the High Plains.","Gustavson, T.C.; Holliday, V.T.","","69",1999,"","","","","","","","","",""

The sand sheet contains ridge and swale, coppice dune, and deflation depression subenvironments. Three distinctive and locally exhumed buried soils occur within these eolian, alluvial, and lacustrine deposits. The youngest buried soil is characterized by an A to Bw to Bk (stage I) profile; the second, by a Btk (stage II) to Bk (stage I) profile; and the third, by a Btk (stage II) to K (stage III or IV) to Bk (stage II) profile. The tops of these buried soils, which in most cases are truncated, represent easily identifiable regional bounding surfaces. They separate the stratigraphic sequence into four units with approximate time spans of 0 to 100 yr B.P. (unit Q4), 100 to 7300 yr B.P. (unit Q3), 9400 to 15,000 yr B.P. (unit Q2), and about 50,000 to 250,000 yr B.P. (unit Q1). Lateral variations in unit thickness delineate eolian depocenters and areas of maximal erosion during these time spans. The stratigraphic sequence records three cyclic alternations between landscape instability, during which erosion and sedimentation took place, and landscape stability, during which the soil profiles became well developed. The initiation of the earliest two episodes of landscape instability, represented by erosion of, or deposition upon, the lower two buried soils, is attributed to climatic change toward drier conditions, which caused the breakup of the sediment-binding vegetative cover. The most recent landscape destabilization episode was initiated about 100 yr B.P. by the destruction of the desert grassland cover by cattle overgrazing. Prehistoric Holocene cultural remains largely are restricted to unit Q3 and the surface of unit Q2, or to the present surface at localities where units Q2 or Q1 are exhumed. Remains found within distinct eolian lag accumulations or within bedded arroyo sediments likely are removed from their original context, the degree to which can be estimated by the extent of incision into the soil-profile horizons.

Community-level phenological patterns may be driven by the filtering of species into communities based on their phenology or by intraspecific responses to local conditions that shift when species flower. To understand the relative roles of filtering and shifting on community-level phenological patterns we compared patterns of first flowering dates (FFD) for herbaceous species at Konza Prairie, KS, USA with those from the colder Fargo, ND, USA area and from Chinnor, England, which has a less continental climate. Comparing patterns of FFD supports that Konza's flowering patterns are potentially influenced both by filtering species that flower early in the growing season and by phenological shifting. Konza species flowering dates were earlier in the spring and later in the fall compared to Fargo, but were not shifted compared to Chinnor, which had a unique suite of early-flowering species. In all, comparing flowering phenology among three sites reveals that intraspecific responses to climate can generate phenological shifts that compress or stretch community-level phenological patterns, while novel niches in phenological space can also alter community-level patterns. Community flowering patterns related to climate suggest that climatic warming has the potential to further distribute flowering of the Konza flora over a longer period, but also could further open it to introductions of non-native species that have evolved to flower early in the season. © 2012 The Authors.

These results replicate previous findings, indicating that upon initiation of conservation action, both cessation of prior management and inception of new management affect specialists negatively and that butterfly declines can be as great on reserves as non-reserves. Results at Wisconsin sites with species-specific management protocols, including permanent non-fire refugia, were more favorable for the specialists (S. idalia, Lycaeides melissa samuelis) the protocols were specifically designed to benefit. Butterfly declines after preservation will likely continue unless the conservation approach changes to include consideration of individual species' required resources and management tolerances. The ecosystem approach assumes that habitat specialists are co-evolved with processes such as fires assumed to maintain those ecosystems. Data presented here indicate that tallgrass prairie specialist butterflies are not co-evolved with current fire regimes. An alternate perspective views ecological processes as resetting vegetation to current climate and landscape conditions. Over geologic time, relict vegetation associations persist as outliers until an event resets them. In modern times, human disturbances (especially soil-exposing ones) can reset sites to favour the more generalist species (plants and butterflies) found in the prevailing, human-degraded landscape. © 2010 The Author(s).","Olsen, F.; Schlicht, D.; Swengel, A.B.; Swengel, S.R.","","15",2011,"Atrytone arogos; Burning; Butterfly declines; Hesperia dacotae; Hesperia ottoe; Lycaeides melissa samuelis; Oarisma poweshiek; Prairie management; Speyeria idalia","","","","","","","","",""

Fossil pollen spectra are compared with modern pollen data to identify the closest analogues and thereby to infer past climatic changes. The late glacial Picea assemblage (ca. 11,638-10,000 varve yr) lacks an exact analogue in the modern vegetation; initially it compares most closely with modern samples from Manitoba and Saskatchewan and later it is most similar to samples from northeastern Canada. The Picea decline at Elk Lake occurs between 10,234 and 9984 varve yr. Within this interval, percentages of Larix, Juniperus, Betula, Quercus, Ulmus, and Fraxinus increase, but the pollen-accumulation rates of these and other taxa decline. The Pinus banksianaresinosa assemblage (10,000-8500 varve yr) has its closest modern analogues in northern Wisconsin and implies warmer slightly drier conditions than before. The prairie period, with high percentages of Quercus, Gramineae, and Artemisia (8500-4400 varve yr), is First matched by surface samples from central and southern Minnesota, then from southern Saskatchewan, and later from southern and central Wisconsin and Minnesota. The change in the location of the analogues suggests gradually wetter conditions after 5723 varve yr. A Quercus-Ostrya assemblage (4400-3000 varve yr) has it modern counterparts in the conifer-hardwood forest of the southern Great Lakes region, where the climate is wetter than that of the prairie period. The Pinus strobus assemblage (3000 varve yr to present) marks the development of cooler moister conditions in the late Holocene.

All orders of birds engage in symbioses with feather mites, which are ectosymbiotic arthropods that spend their entire life on hosts. Due to their permanent obligatory association with hosts, limited dispersal and primarily vertical transmission, we hypothesized that the cospeciation between feather mites and hosts within one avian family (Parulidae) would be perfect (strict cospeciation). We assessed cophylogenetic patterns and tested for congruence between species in two confamiliar feather mite genera (Proctophyllodidae: Proctophyllodes, Amerodectes) found on 13 species of migratory warblers (and one other closely related migratory species) in the eastern United States. Based on COI sequence data, we found three Proctophyllodes lineages and six Amerodectes lineages. Distance- and event-based cophylogenetic analyses suggested different cophylogenetic trajectories of the two mite genera, and although some associations were significant, there was little overall evidence supporting strict cospeciation. Host switching is likely responsible for incongruent phylogenies. In one case, we documented prairie warblers Setophaga discolor harboring two mite species of the same genus. Most interestingly, we found strong evidence that host ecology may influence the likelihood of host switching occurring. For example, we documented relatively distantly related ground-nesting hosts (ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla and Kentucky warbler Geothlypis formosa) sharing a single mite species, while other birds are shrub/canopy or cavity nesters. Overall, our results suggest that cospeciation is not the case for feather mites and parulid hosts at this fine phylogenetic scale, and raise the question if cospeciation applies for other symbiotic systems involving hosts that have complex life histories. We also provide preliminary evidence that incorporating host ecological traits into cophylogenetic analyses may be useful for understanding how symbiotic systems have evolved. © 2017 The Authors","Boves, T.J.; Diener, L.; Dowling, A.P.G.; Fiss, C.J.; Hager, S.B.; Klimov, P.B.; Larkin, J.L.; Matthews, A.E.; McNeil, D.J.; Proctor, H.C.; Raybuck, D.W.","","49",2018,"Acari; birds; coevolution; cophylogenetic analysis; cospeciation; host–symbiont; symbiosis","","","","","","","","",""

However, global change factors, such as eutrophication and invasion, can alter plant community composition and thus change the distribution of flowering across the growing season. We examined three ecoregions (tall-, mixed, and short-grass prairie) across the U.S. Central Plains to determine how nutrient (nitrogen (N), phosphorus, and potassium (+micronutrient)) addition alters the temporal patterns of plant flowering traits. We calculated total community flowering potential (FP) by distributing peakseason plant cover values across the growing season, allocating each species' cover to only those months in which it typically flowers. We also generated separate FP profiles for exotic and native species and functional group. We compared the ability of the added nutrients to shift the distribution of these FP profiles (total and sub-groups) across the growing season. In all ecoregions, N increased the relative cover of both exotic species and C3 graminoids that flower in May through August. The cover of C4 graminoids decreased with added N, but the response varied by ecoregion and month. However, these functional changes only aggregated to shift the entire community's FP profile in the tall-grass prairie, where the relative cover of plants expected to flower in May and June increased and those that flower in September and October decreased with added N. The relatively low native cover in May and June may leave this ecoregion vulnerable to disturbance-induced invasion by exotic species that occupy this temporal niche. There was no change in the FP profile of the mixed and short-grass prairies with N addition as increased abundance of exotic species and C3 graminoids replaced other species that flower at the same time. In these communities a disturbance other than nutrient addition may be required to disrupt phenological patterns.","Biederman, L.; Fay, P.; Hagenah, N.; Knops, J.; La Pierre, K.; Laungani, R.; Lind, E.; McCulley, R.; Mortensen, B.; Power, S.; Seabloom, E.; Tognetti, P.","","12",2017,"","","","","","","","","",""

Previous work demonstrated dietary modification in response to interglacial warming; however, it is difficult to know if these changes resulted from changing climates, alterations of their habitat, or both. Here, we further investigate the influences of increasing evaporative conditions and changing vegetation on diets using oxygen and carbon isotopes from medium- to large-bodied herbivores from Pleistocene sites in Florida (Haile 8A, Tri-Britton, Leisey Shell Pit 1A, Inglis 1A). Bulk and serial stable isotope values indicate that Tri-Britton was the warmest and driest site with forests and C4 grasslands, and may have been able to support closely related taxa (e.g. multiple peccaries and camelids). In contrast to Tri-Briton and Leisey Shell Pit 1A, Haile 8A was the wettest site and may have represented a transitional climate. The diets of Hemiauchenia, Platygonus, and Mylohyus changed from browsing (Inglis 1A, Haile 8A) to mixed feeding (Leisey Shell Pit 1A, Tri-Britton), potentially in response to warmer temperatures and/or more arid environments. Mammut, Odocoileus, and Palaeolama maintained primarily C3 diets at all sites; however, δ13C values were greatest at Leisey Shell Pit 1A and Tri-Britton. Tapirus and Equus also had significantly greater δ13C values at Tri-Britton as compared to other sites, further suggesting more evaporative conditions. With higher temperatures and/or increased aridity, dietary generalists modified their diets more than specialists, often including a greater proportion of C4 vegetation than during cooler and/or wetter periods. Collectively, these data suggest that increased evaporative conditions during the Pleistocene may have contributed to a broader range of diets in generalist herbivores when compared to dietary specialists. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","DeSantis, L.R.G.; Yann, L.T.","","414",2014,"Climate; Diet; Florida; Pleistocene; Relative aridity; Stable isotopes","","","","","","","","",""

Methods are described for soil preparation, seed collection, seed treatment for germination, and planting rates. After creating a prairie, management is essential, such as safely conducting controlled burns and eliminating aggressive alien plants. Prairie restoration is essential, not only for aesthetic beauty, but prairies provide food for a variety of insects evolved to feed on our native plants. Insects in turn sustain a population of native birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Described in detail are over 200 species of grasses and forbs most commonly found in tallgrass prairies, most with accompanying photo illustrations. An appendix outlines about 900 additional species that are occasionally found on prairies. In addition, the Springer website illustrates detailed scanned herbarium samples and scanned seeds with accompanying seed-heads. These digitally scanned samples are invaluable for positive identification. This book is recommended for students, landscapers, horticulturists, hobbyists, and land managers.

Changes in the proportion of different morphotypes indicate large shifts in vegetation composition during the last 100 ka. A low-elevation section (677 m asl) near the center of the basin provided a record of alternating xeric Festuca-Poa and mesic Festuca-Koeleria grassland. The middle-slope section (1095 m asl) supported Picea-Abies or Pinus ponderosa forest or non-analog parkland at different times. Some trees were present at or near the site even during the Last Glacial Maximum. The highest site (1220 m asl) supported Stipa-, Festuca- and Poa-dominated grassland with some Artemisia shrub during most of the late Pleistocene, but supports a coniferous forest today. Variations in vegetation can be explained as a response to changes in large-scale climatic controls. Grasslands and shrub steppe were apparently more widespread and forests more restricted than today during the marine isotope stages 2 and 4, probably as a result of cooler and drier conditions. The three new records are well correlated with previously published paleo-reconstructions based on phytolith, cicada burrow and stable isotope data from a nearby KP-1 loess section, Carp Lake pollen record, and global ice volume variations. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Literature review shows that Indians practiced regular use of fire for many purposes, including the obvious reasons of increasing the availability of desired plants, maintaining habitats for animals used as food, and driving game during hunts. Historical accounts of prehistoric anthropogenic firing, inferences from fire-scar data, and data regarding annual production capability of representative sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)-perennial grass ecological sites indicate that prehistoric conditions were neither fuel-nor ignition-limited. According to many sources, this ""active management"" by Indians was widespread, significant, and more common than lightning-caused fires, resulting in mosaic vegetation patterns that subsequently moderated the behavior of ""natural fires."" This interaction between Indian-burning and lightning fires may have strongly influenced the pre-Euro-American settlement vegetation of the Great Basin. At the very least, the landscape was a patchwork of areas altered by aboriginal people and areas shaped primarily by bio-physical processes. Based on this prehistoric precedent, current historically unprecedented conditions (fuel load and exotic weed invasion threats), and predicted climate change, contemporary active management of sagebrush-perennial grass communities is paramount. Restoration measures should be scientifically based and tailored to achieve ecological resilience and functionality in specific sites. Prescribed fire is not always ecologically appropriate or judicious, especially in Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata spp. wyomingensis) communities, so managers should consider using other alternatives where an intentional low severity distubance is deemed necessary. Properly planned active management would disrupt fuel continuity for lighthning fires, ensure ecological process and successional integrity, and benefit multiple uses on a landscape scale. © 2013 The Society for Range Management.","Kent McAdoo, J.; Schultz, B.W.; Swanson, S.R.","","66",2013,"Artemisia; aboriginal fire; disturbance; historic range of variation (HRV); rangeland restoration; resilience","","","","","","","","",""

To determine whether geographic variation in morphology parallels variation in migratory behavior and mitochondrial DNA, I used measurements of museum specimens from throughout the Prairie Warbler's range. The subspecies differ in overall body size, with birds of the Florida subspecies (D. d. paludicola) significantly larger than the nominate race. Males of the subspecies differ in the extent of white coloration in the outer rectrices.

Some birds engage in between-year breeding dispersal, but the factors shaping variation in this behavior are not well understood. In mid-continental grasslands, preliminary evidence suggested that Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) dispersed not only between seasons, but also within breeding seasons-an apparently uncommon avian behavior. We studied a population of Grasshopper Sparrows breeding in northeastern Kansas, USA, to document the spatial and temporal patterns of within-season breeding dispersal in an experimentally managed tallgrass prairie from 2013 to 2015. We combined color-band resighting, territory mapping, and radio telemetry to quantify changes in territory density, turnover of territorial males, and dispersal distances. Density of Grasshopper Sparrows varied seasonally in management-specific ways, simultaneously increasing and decreasing in watersheds that differed in management regime. Turnover was unexpectedly high, with over half of territorial males being replaced each month. We documented over a third of males dispersing up to ∼9 km between breeding attempts. Our study provides the first comprehensive description of the patterns of within-season breeding dispersal in a grassland songbird. Our results reveal the remarkable prevalence of within-season movement in this system and the relatively large distances over which birds disperse.

Historical perspectives increase our understanding of the dynamic nature of landscapes and provide a frame of reference for assessing modern patterns and processes. Historical records, however, are often too brief or fragmentary to be useful, or they are not obtainable for the process or structure of interest. Even where long historical time series can be assembled, selection of appropriate reference conditions may be complicated by the past influence of humans and the many potential reference conditions encompassed by nonequilibrium dynamics. These complications, however, do not lessen the value of history; rather they underscore the need for multiple, comparative histories from many locations for evaluating both cultural and natural causes of variability, as well as for characterizing the overall dynamical properties of ecosystems. Historical knowledge may not simplify the task of setting management goals and making decisions, but 20th century trends, such as increasingly severe wildfires, suggest that disregarding history can be perilous. We describe examples from our research in the southwestern United States to illustrate some of the values and limitations of applied historical ecology. Paleoecological data from packrat middens and other natural archives have been useful for defining baseline conditions of vegetation communities, determining histories and rates of species range expansions and contractions, and discriminating between natural and cultural causes of environmental change. We describe a montane grassland restoration project in northern New Mexico that was justified and guided by an historical sequence of aerial photographs showing progressive tree invasion during the 20th century. Likewise, fire scar chronologies have been widely used to justify and guide fuel reduction and natural five reintroduction in forests. A southwestern network of fire histories illustrates the power of aggregating historical time series across spatial scales. Regional fire patterns evident in these aggregations point to the key role of interannual lags in responses of fuels and fire regimes to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (wet/dry cycles), with important implications for long-range fire hazard forecasting. These examples of applied historical ecology emphasize that detection and explanation of historical trends and variability are essential to informed management.","Allen, C.D.; Betancourt, J.L.; Swetnam, T.W.","","9",1999,"Climate change; Disturbance; Fire history; Historical ecology; Packrat middens; Paleoecology; Range of natural variation; Repeat photography; Restoration; Southwestern United States; Tree rings; Vegetation change","","","","","","","","",""

Seepage of saltwater through semi-confining layers","This paper presents a generalized basic study that addresses practical needs for an understanding of the major mechanisms involved in the mineralization of groundwater in the Great Bend Prairie aquifer in south- central Kansas. This Quaternary alluvial aquifer and associated surface waters are subject to contamination by saltwater, which in some areas seeps from the deeper Permian bedrock formation into the overlying freshwater aquifer through semiconfining layers. A simplified conceptual model is adopted. It incorporates the freshwater aquifer whose bottom is comprised of a semiconfining layer through which a hydrologically minor but geochemically important saline water discharge seeps into the aquifer. A hierarchy of approximate approaches is considered to analyze the mineralization processes taking place in the aquifer. The recently developed top specified boundary layer (TSBL) approach is very convenient to use for the initial characterization of these processes, and is further adapted to characterization of head-driven seepage through semi-confining layers. TSBL calculations indicate that the seeping saline water may create two distinct new zones in the aquifer: (1) a completely saline zone (CSZ) adjacent to the semiconfining bottom of the aquifer, and (2) a transition zone (TZ) which develops between the CSZ and the freshwater zone. Some possible scenarios associated with the various mineralization patterns are analyzed and discussed.","Buddemeier, R.W.; Rubin, H.","","32",1998,"Inland aquifer mineralization; Seepage; Top specified boundary layer (TSBL)","","","","","","","","",""

We monitored precipitation, overland flow, soil moisture, and headcut migration over several seasonal cycles at two adjacent rangeland channel heads in southern Arizona. Erosion occurred by headward retreat of vertical to overhanging faces, driven dominantly by surface runoff. No evidence exists for erosion caused by shallow-groundwater-related processes, even though similar theater-headed morphologies are sometimes attributed to seepage erosion by emerging groundwater. At our field site, vertical variation in soil shear strength influenced the persistence of the characteristic theater-head form. The dominant processes of erosion included removal of grains and soil aggregates during even very shallow (1-3 cm) overland flow events by runoff on vertical to overhanging channel headwalls, plunge-pool erosion during higher-discharge runoff events, immediate postrunoff wet mass wasting, and minor intra-event dry mass wasting on soil tension fractures developing subparallel to the headwall. Multiple stepwise linear regression indicates that the migration rate is most strongly correlated with flow duration and total precipitation and is poorly correlated with peak flow depth or time-integrated flow depth. The studied channel heads migrated upslope with a self-similar morphologic form under a wide range of hydrological conditions, and the most powerful flash floods were not always responsible for the largest changes in landscape form in this environment. © 2014 Geological Society of America.","DeLong, S.B.; Johnson, J.P.L.; Whipple, K.X.","","126",2014,"","","","","","","","","",""

Conservation easements are a common tool for range conservation, but the perpetual nature of their individually negotiated rights and restrictions may present a challenge for adaptive land management. The evolution of conservation easement approaches to land management was addressed in a review of 52 grazing easements created by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in California rangelands between 1973 and 2006 as well as through interviews with TNC staff. Easement terms related to land management increased in complexity over time, particularly for purchased easements on private land. Easements commonly contained restrictions on riparian or wetland management (58), residual dry matter (50), and type of animal permitted (46) but rarely restricted number of cattle or animal unit months (4). Flexibility was provided by easement terms such as exceptions for drought years and reference to best management practices, the easement holder's administrative discretion, and easement amendment. Interviews with TNC staff revealed an iterative process in which conservation easements remain relatively fixed once they are established, whereas subsequent easements incorporate lessons learned from easement monitoring, enforcement, management, and applicable science. Conservation easements with an adaptive approach would link compliance terms with conservation goals, require monitoring of those terms, and have a mechanism for altering land management based on monitoring results. All three of these realms present challenges for the conservation easement structure. Improvements could be made in easement terms, ecological monitoring, and stewardship to improve the effectiveness and adaptability of this tool for maintaining ecological function on working ranches. © Society for Range Management.","Rissman, A.R.","","63",2010,"California oak woodlands; grazing policy; land conservation; land trusts; policy instruments; range management; residual dry matter; working landscapes","","","","","","","","",""

The formation spans the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO; 17-14 Ma) and offers the opportunity to study environmental change during the last major interval of global warming of the Cenozoic. We combined isotopic analyses of carbon and hydrogen from sedimentary n-alkanes and bulk soil organic matter with analysis of phytoliths (plant silica) and diatoms to reconstruct vegetation composition, habitat structure, and moisture dynamics through the formation. The δ13C and δD of long-carbon-chain n-alkanes derived from terrestrial plants and preserved in sediments of the Barstow Formation record drying prior to the MMCO and through the Middle Miocene Climatic Transition (MMCT; beginning ca. 14 Ma), punctuated by increased moisture in fluvial environments during the peak of the MMCO. Variable isotopic results relate to changes in moisture, driven partly by facies, vegetation composition, tectonic activity, and climatic variability coinciding with intervals of high pCO2. Phytolith assemblages are dominated by forest indicators in riparian habitats during the MMCO, and grass morphotypes constitute significant components of phytolith assemblages after the MMCO, indicating a shift to drier, more open-canopy habitats. The establishment of dry, wooded grasslands in the Barstow Basin coincides with the beginning of the MMCT and cooling sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean.

To determine how potential microbial accessibility and turnover of these compounds is impacted by encroachment of woody plants into grasslands, we investigated changes in evolved CO 2 during thermal analysis and in carbohydrate and amino compound chemistry after long term laboratory incubation of sandy loam grassland woodland soils from southern Texas, USA. Thermal analysis showed that incubation increased the amount of soil organic matter (SOM) released at higher temperatures and that evolved CO 2 profiles correlated with increases in amino C. During incubation, total carbohydrate C decreased slightly faster than bulk soil C, with preferential loss of plant-derived carbohydrates and/or production of microbial carbohydrates most strongly expressed in grassland and younger woodland soils. Total N content did not change during incubation, so the reduction in extractable amino N in older woodland soils suggested that N became more resistant to extraction during incubation. These data, along with previous measurements of respired CO 2, indicate that changes in carbohydrate C and amino C did not predict mineralized CO 2 yields and that amino compounds and microbial carbohydrate C were not selectively lost during incubation. The differing response in SOM loss (or enrichment) during incubation of the older woodland soils revealed a system with altered SOM dynamics due to woody encroachment, confirming that the short term 'lability' or 'recalcitrance' of SOM components is dependent on a number of interacting variables. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Boutton, T.W.; Creamer, C.A.; Filley, T.R.; Olk, D.C.; Peltre, C.; Plante, A.; Top, S.M.","","52",2012,"","","","","","","","","",""

Examination of the Member reveals that it does not wholly represent offshore deposition, as previously interpreted, but instead contains three nearshore faciès associations: (1) tidally influenced fluvial channel fills, (2) fluvial-dominated delta fronts, and (3) weakly storm-influenced shorefaces. Tidally influenced fluvial channel fills are commonly stacked into multistory bodies that can be traced for tens of kilometers at discrete stratigraphie levels, defining incised-valley-fill networks. Four such incised-valley networks are identified at outcrop. Fluvial-dominated deltas and weakly storminfluenced shorefaces are eroded into by, and lie at the down-dip terminations of, incised-valley fills and are interpreted as forced regressive and low stand shoreface deposits. One incised-valley fill appears to be onlapped by additional fluvial-dominated deltas, which represent pulses of shoreface progradation during an overall transgression. Forced regressive, low stand, and transgressive shorefaces in the Prairie Canyon Member differ significantly from highstand shorefaces in the Blackhawk Formation.

Extensive erosion surfaces were developed prior to glaciation, such as the Alberta Plateau of northeastern British Columbia and the Yukon Plateau in southern Yukon. In the region from Dawson Creek to Fort Nelson, British Columbia, the drift is dominantly a slightly weathered bouldery clay till of Wisconsin age, deposited by ice that came from the east. In the northern Rocky Mountains, the last eastward advance of the Wisconsin glaciers to the mountain front preceded the maximum westward advance of the ice sheets. In the foothills belt west of the Highway, the tills of these two advances are separated by lake deposits. Much of the drift is probably pre-Altamont in age and was subjected to vigorous frost action during the Altamont substage. The climate ameliorated perhaps with the advent of the post-glacial optimum and possibly coincident with the development of prairies. A recent change from prairie to forest perhaps indicates a slight cooling in recent time. In the northern Rocky Mountains, four substages of Wisconsin glaciation are recognized tentatively on the basis of morainal deposits and outwash terraces. The upper Liard basin is characterized by extensive pitted outwash plains, probably of late Wisconsin age. From Teslin Lake to Whitehorse, the Highway is bordered by extensive terraces of gravel and sand deposited in ice-marginal streams and lakes. Intensive frost action has modified pre-existing land forms and has produced a wide variety of features, such as talus, blockfields, stone rings, stone stripes, and terraces. Long smooth slopes, chiefly due to mass movements such as solifluction, are characteristic of the landscapes. These slopes and ancient soil structures extend down into forested areas and probably developed prior to the advent of forests, doubtless prior to the post-glacial optimum.

This sequence, lying stratigraphically between the Prairie terrace and the Holoceneflood-plain, can be distinguished partly by large meander scars that are characteristic of the terrace where it is present on several coastal plain streams. Previous investigations have established the age of the Deweyville terraces as being between 13,000 and 30,000 years B.P.; however, opinions vary regarding mode of origin. Morphologic characteristics of and stratigraphic relationships between the terraces along the Ouachita River indicate that a close causal relationship existed between the terraces and major episodes of aggradation and degradation in the Mississippi alluvial valley, but changes in hydraulic regimen brought about by climatic change were also significant. The chronological sequence indicated for the Ouachita Valley includes: (1) deposition of the Prairie terrace formation during the Sangamon Interglacial Stage; (2) primary valley degradation and deep stream entrenchment during waxing Early Wisconsin glaciation; (3) alluviation during waning Early Wisconsin glaciation with maximum valley aggradation occurring during the Farmdalian Substage; (4) secondary valley degradation and moderate entrenchment sduring waxing Late Wisconsin glaciation; and (5) alluviation and valley aggradation during waning Late Wisconsin glaciation, continuing into the Holocene. Rapid deposition of glacial outwash in the Mississippi Valley, including the development of an alluvial cone by the Arkansas River, resulted in the damming of the lower end of the Ouachita Valley during the Farmdalian Substage. A 500-to 700-sq-mi perennial lake, called Lake Monroe, was created by the damming; shoreline features and lacustrine plain remnants of the lake compose what is recognized as the highest and intermediate Deweyville terraces. The lowest Deweyville terrace was created subsequently during a period of waxing glaciation and valley entrenchment and under the influence of a pluvial climate.

There are eleven mines in Saskatchewan that annually produce approximately 23 Mt of KCl from halite-sylvite ore associated with the 60 m thick upper interval of the Prairie Evaporite Formation. Of these, eight mines are conventional underground operations at 900–1100 m depths. Solution mining is used at three sites where the ore is buried to 1500 m depth or where this methodology was a necessary remedial action responding to flooding of an underground dry mine. Two new underground mines are currently under construction. The Prairie Evaporite Formation accumulated during the Middle Devonian along an evaporating equatorial inland sea that extended onto the Laurentia paleocontinent. Development of a 400 km long reef at the northern seaward end barred the basin, permitting accumulation of up to 200 m of halite-dominated evaporite beds across north-central Alberta, southern Saskatchewan and into adjacent areas of the United States. Late cycle potassium-rich brines concentrated within the southern Saskatchewan sub-basin, resulting in accumulation of potash ore zones as the uppermost interval of the 100–200 m thick halite-anhydrite deposit. Early diagenetic processes resulted in widespread concentration of sylvite-rich beds upon leaching of Mg chloride from carnallite-rich deposits, resulting in commercially attractive potash ore. Subsequent post-burial dissolution of halite-dominated beds occurred across large areas of Alberta and southern Saskatchewan, including portions of the potash mining districts. Natural dissolution collapse-subsidence structures up to 10 s km long may have permitted some mining areas to be in contact with basin brines. Brines may have also mixed with descending groundwater sourced from Cretaceous strata up-section if the carbonate seals of the overlying Dawson Bay Formation were compromised by fracturing. Mining methodologies are designed to minimize the mine-scale subsidence upon ore removal and limit potential fracturing of overlying Dawson Bay limestone beds. Brine seeps into the underground mines vary from controllable nuisances to catastrophic flooding of underground workings. Remedial actions such as grouting generally control the seeps, but uncontrollable ingress has resulted in one underground operation being converted into a solution mine. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Broughton, P.L.","","113",2019,"Carnallite; Halite; Potash; Prairie Evaporite; Salt dissolution; Sylvite","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, strong westerly winds were transporting large amounts of dust into the region, mixing with the smoke and debris already being generated. This research uses surface- and satellite-based remote sensing observations of this event to assess the locations of fires and the spatial distribution of smoke and dust aerosols. The authors present a unique perspective by analyzing radar observations of fire debris in conjunction with the satellite analysis of submicrometer smoke aerosol particles. Satellite data clearly show the location of the individual fires and the downwind smoke plumes as well as the large dust stormpresent over the region. In particular, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical thickness at 0.55 μm within the dust plume was around 0.5, and it increased to greater than 1.0 when combined with smoke. Using the difference in 11- versus 12-μm brightness temperature data combined with surface observations, the large extent of the dust plume was evident through much of northcentral Texas, where visibilities were low and the 11-12-μm brightness temperature difference was negative. Conversely, smoke plumes were characterized by higher reflectance at 0.6 μm (visible wavelength). Cross sections of radar data through the several smoke and debris plumes indicated the burnt debris reached up to 5 kminto the atmosphere. Plume height output from modified severe stormalgorithms produced similar values. Since smoke aerosols are smaller and lighter when compared with the debris, they were likely being transported even higher into the atmosphere. These results show that the combination of satellite and radar data offers a unique perspective on observing the characteristics and evolution of smoke and debris plume emanating from grass fire events. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.","Christopher, S.A.; Jones, T.A.","","49",2010,"","","","","","","","","",""

The sediments of the prairie lakes just west of Elk Lake are unusual in that they commonly contain high-Mg calcite and dolomite in addition to low-Mg calcite, which is the dominant carbonate mineral in most marl lakes. During the mid-Holocene dry period, prairie conditions expanded eastward into the forested regions of Minnesota. Variations in types and abundances of carbonate minerals in the Holocene sediments of Elk Lake recorded this climatic change. Studies of primary productivity, carbonate saturation, water chemistry, and sediment-trap samples show that low-Mg calcite precipitates during the summer, triggered by algal photosynthesis. The epilimnion of Elk Lake is always oversaturated with calcite, and the degree of oversaturation increases progressively during the summer. The pH of the epilimnion increases from 8.0 after spring overturn to almost 9.0 in late summer in response to photosynthetic removal of CO2 during the summer months. The rate of calcium depletion from the epilimnion is proportional to the increase in pH and the rate of photosynthetic carbon fixation. Today the only carbonate minerals that are accumulating in the sediments of Elk Lake are low-Mg calcite and manganese carbonate (rhodochrosite). Rhodochrosite, and probably manganese oxyhydroxide, precipitates when manganese-rich anoxic bottom waters come in contact with carbonate-rich oxic surface waters. During the arid mid- Holocene prairie period, however, low-Mg calcite, dolomite, aragonite, and rhodochrosite all accumulated in the sediments of Elk Lake. Dolomite formed in Elk Lake during this period in response to a higher Mg:Ca ratio in the water, just as it is forming today in lakes of the prairie regions of western Minnesota. The coincident occurrence of aragonite and biological indicators of high salinity suggests that the salinity of Elk Lake and the Mg:Ca ratio were higher than in any of the present prairie lakes of western Minnesota.","Dean, W.E.; Megard, R.O.","","276",1993,"","","","","","","","","",""

Grassland arthropods that rely directly on herbaceous plants for food, shelter, or as substrates for reproduction are especially vulnerable to these invasions because many have evolved specialized relationships with host plants that might be displaced. We evaluated how invasions by nonnative grasses affected abundance and richness of foliage-dwelling arthropods in semidesert grasslands of Arizona, USA. On 90, 3.1-ha plots established along a gradient of invasion where dominance of nonnative grasses ranged from 0 to nearly 100% of grass cover, we captured > 90,000 arthropods from 11 orders during 270 surveys in 2014 and 2015. Although the invasion by nonnative grasses (primarily Eragrostis lehmanniana and secondarily E. curvula) increased the amount of herbaceous foliage available to arthropods, richness of arthropods decreased by an average of 2% and total abundance by an average of 7% for every 10% increase in nonnative-grass dominance. Responses to the plant invasion, however, varied among taxa and functional groups. As dominance of nonnative grasses increased, abundances of most predators and specialist herbivores decreased, whereas abundances of most generalist herbivores were lowest at intermediate points of the invasion gradient. The changes we observed in the arthropod community have potential to alter broad-scale ecological processes, including energy flow and nutrient cycling, and to reduce food resources for insectivores, which can have adverse, cascading effects on imperiled grassland ecosystems. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Andersen, E.M.; Cambrelin, M.N.; Steidl, R.J.","","21",2019,"Eragrostis lehmanniana; Exotic species; Insect; Invasive species; Invertebrate; Semidesert","","","","","","","","",""

A detailed reconstruction of this time interval is critical for understanding the nature of biotic and environmental changes preceding the end-Cretaceous Mass Extinction event and for deciphering the likely extinction mechanism (i.e., bolide impact versus volcanism). Eight sections encompassing the K/Pg succession across the Mississippi Embayment were analyzed using biostratigraphic sampling of ammonites, dinoflagellates, and nannofossils. An upper Maastrichtian ammonite zonation is proposed as follows, from oldest to youngest: Discoscaphites conradi Zone, D. minardi Zone, and D. iris Zone. Our study documents that the ammonite zonation established in the Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP) extends to the GCP. This zonation is integrated with nannofossil and dinoflagellate biostratigraphy to provide a framework to more accurately determine the age relationships in this region. We demonstrate that ammonites and dinoflagellates are more reliable stratigraphic indicators in this area than nannofossils because age-diagnostic nannofossils are not consistently present within the upper Maastrichtian in the GCP. This biostratigraphic framework has the potential to become a useful tool for correlation of strata both within the GCP and between the GCP, Western Interior, and ACP. The presence of the uppermost Maastrichtian ammonite D. iris, calcareous nannofossil Micula prinsii, and dinoflagellates Palynodinium grallator and Disphaerogena carposphaeropsis suggests that the K/Pg succession in the GCP is nearly complete.

We used an integrated physiochemical dataset combining plot spatial data with temporal data from tree cores to evaluate changes in soils and vegetation. Data suggest that this unique habitat is undergoing a transition, endangering local biodiversity and endemic plant species. The objective of this work was to analyse the vegetation dynamics of a xeric serpentine savanna located in the Mid-Atlantic, USA. We employed vegetation surveys of 32 10×15 m quadrats to obtain woody species composition, density, basal area, and developed a spatial physiochemical dataset of substrate geochemistry to independently summarise the data using regression and ordination techniques. This information was interpreted alongside historical, dendrochronologic and soil stable carbon isotopic data to evaluate successional dynamics. Comparisons among geologic, pedologic and vegetation environmental drivers indicated broad correlations across an environmental gradient, corresponding to a grassland to forest transition. The woodland communities appear to be part of a complex soil moisture and chemistry gradient that affects the extent, density, basal area and species composition of these communities. Over the gradient, there is an increase in α diversity, a decrease in the density of xeric and invasive species, and an increase in stem density of more mesic species. Dendrochronology suggests poor recruitment of xeric species and concomitant increase in more mesic species. The data indicated that former C4-dominated grasslands were initially invaded by conifers and are now experiencing mesophication, with growing dominance by Acer, Nyssa and more mesic Quercus and Fagus species. © CSIRO 2015.","Burgess, J.; Lev, S.; Rajakaruna, N.; Swan, C.; Szlavecz, K.","","63",2015,"edaphic; plant-soil relations; serpentine; succession","","","","","","","","",""

There were greater numbers (normalized by county area) of soil orders, suborders, and great groups in counties within the transition zone than in those outside the zone. A zone of soils containing glossic horizons extends 75. km to the north of the Wisconsin transition zone separates Alfisols (dominantly Hapludalfs) and Mollisols in the south from Spodosols and Glossudalfs in the north; this zone may represent the mid-Holocene position of the tension zone. Soil endemism is a concept whereby soils are restricted to a limited geographic area based on a unique set of soil-forming factors. In this study, endemic soils were identified on the basis of having a centralized distribution, lacking competing soil series, and being unique to Wisconsin and adjoining states. Although the transition zone contains 13% of the state's area, it has 40% of the endemic soils.

The capacity of this species to invade edaphically stressful serpentine soil is especially unusual. It is unclear whether genetic differentiation, phenotypic plasticity, or both have allowed A. triuncialis to invade competitive (i.e. high productivity non-serpentine annual grassland) and edaphically stressful (i.e. low productivity serpentine) environments. We used a reciprocal transplant field experiment to examine the effects of plasticity and genetic variation on A. triuncialis phenology and demography along invasion fronts associated with interspecific competition and edaphic gradients. We reciprocally transplanted seeds collected behind invasion fronts (core subpopulations) and along invasion fronts (edge subpopulations). For both gradient types we measured higher reproduction and population growth at invasion front edges. This was true for both edge and core subpopulation seed sources, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity may facilitate invasive spread. Consistent planting site effects indicated that phenotypic plasticity is a primary contributor to A. triuncialis demographic responses along interspecific competition gradients. In contrast, significant seed source effects suggest genetic differentiation along invasion fronts in serpentine edaphic gradients. Although persistent maternal environmental effects cannot be ruled out entirely, seed source effects suggest genetic differences between serpentine subpopulations located behind and beyond the invasion fronts for plant survival, plant size, total seed production, and individual seed size.

Seldom, however, can patterns of flower abundance and visitation in the field be linked with the behavioral mechanisms that allow floral visitors to persist when a preferred resource is scarce. To explore these mechanisms better, we examined factors controlling floral preference in the hawk-moth Manduca sexta in the semiarid grassland of Arizona. Here, hawkmoths forage primarily on flowers of the bat-adapted agave, Agave palmeri, but shift to the moth-adapted flowers of their larval host plant, Datura wrightii, when these become abundant. Both plants emit similar concentrations of floral odor, but scent composition, nectar, and flower reflectance are distinct between the two species, and A. palmeri flowers provide six times as much chemical energy as flowers of D. wrightii. Behavioral experiments with both naïve and experienced moths revealed that hawkmoths learn to feed from agave flowers through olfactory conditioning but readily switch to D. wrightii flowers, for which they are the primary pollinator, based on an innate odor preference. Behavioral flexibility and the olfactory contrast between flowers permit the hawkmoths to persist within a dynamic environment, while at the same time to function as the major pollinator of one plant species. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Abrell, L.; Alarcón, R.; Bronstein, J.L.; Davidowitz, G.; Hildebrand, J.G.; Riffell, J.A.","","105",2008,"Flower visitation; Foraging behavior; Moth; Pollination","","","","","","","","",""

The temporal evolution of atmospherically corrected NDVI images through two growing seasons was found to be consistent among sensors. Maximum NDVI compositing of AVHRR data compared favourably with Landsat TM and SPOT-HRV, despite large variations in individual band reflectances with viewing geometry. Surface radiant temperatures retrieved from the various sensors, including aircraft TM-simulators, were also comparable, and in good agreement with surface measurements after radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction (2.7°C rmse). The relationship between NDVI and Ts was determined largely by vegetation and environmental conditions (e.g., leaf area index and soil moisture), and was thus related to the partitioning of energy fluxes. The NDVI/Ts slopes were also affected by acquisition time, but were not significantly different among sensors over the growing season. These results suggest that data from different sensors can be used to augment spatial and temporal characteristics of datasets, when calibrated and corrected. Such capability diminishes the trade-off of spatial resolution at the expense of temporal resolution (and vice versa), thus allowing observation of short-term variations in biospheric processes. © 1997 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Goetz, S.J.","","18",1997,"","","","","","","","","",""

The macrofossil record of grasses is sparse, likely due to the limited preservation potential of grasses. Diagnosis of the C3 or C4 photosynthetic pathway depends on preservation of both cellular structures and organic carbon for isotope analysis. Here we analyze the anatomical and isotopic composition of newly-collected grass fossils from the Dove Spring Formation, Red Rock Canyon State Park, California, USA, located in the El Paso Basin on the western side of the Basin and Range Province, a site previously identified as one of the earliest known C4 grass fossil bearing localities.

The fossils analyzed in this study include grass shoots and in cross-section display anatomy indicative of the C3 photosynthetic pathway. We isolated organic carbon from the stem fossils and determined the carbon isotopic composition to be − 24.8 ± 0.5‰. Together, the anatomical and geochemical analyses confirm that these plants used the C3 photosynthetic pathway. Our findings are consistent with dietary evidence based on tooth enamel from grazing mammals of available C3 resources in the same sections.

Aboveground biomass was greater in exotic than native plots, and this difference was larger in mixtures than in monocultures. Species diversity declined more in exotic than native communities and declines were explained by different mechanisms. In exotic communities, overyielding species had high biomass in monoculture and diversity declined linearly as this selection effect increased. In native communities, however, overyielding species had low biomass in monoculture and there was no relationship between the selection effect and diversity decline.

Within the Holocene record are numerous short intervals in which mercury concentrations and accumulation rates exceed the modern values. The highest mercury concentrations formed ca. 8 ka, coincident with a rapid change from cool, moist conditions to warm, dry conditions. A related change in flora from pine forest to prairie caused destruction of organic forest soils and the release of mercury that had been sequestered in them, resulting in a short- lived pulse of mercury to the lake. Accumulation rates of mercury were highest during the 4 k.y. mid-Holocene dry interval and show a correlation with periods of rapid deposition of eolian dust.

As a consequence of human actions, many remaining grasslands have become homogenous, which has led to reduced ecosystem function, biodiversity loss, and decreased ecological services. Previous research has shown that restoring inherent heterogeneity to grasslands can increase avian diversity, but the amount of heterogeneity (i.e., number of patches or fire return interval) and the impact on avian community stability have yet to be investigated. We used a unique landscape-level design to examine avian response to interacting fire and grazing across multiple experimental landscapes that represented a gradient of fire- and grazing-dependent heterogeneity. We used seven landscapes (430-980 ha; x¯ = 627 ha) with varying levels of patchiness ranging from annually burned (one single patch) with spring-only fires to a four-year fire return interval with spring and summer fires (eight patches). This design created a range of heterogeneity as a result of pyric herbivory, an ecological process in which fire and grazing are allowed to interact in space and time. We found that greater heterogeneity across experimental landscapes resulted in increased avian diversity and stability over time. An index of bird community change, quantified as the sum of the range of detrended correspondence analysis axis site scores, was nearly four times greater in the most homogenous experimental landscape when compared to the most heterogeneous experimental landscape. Species responses were consistently positively associated with increased heterogeneity at the landscape scale, and within-experimentallandscape responses were most often related to litter cover, litter accumulation, and vegetation height. We conclude that increased fire- and grazing-dependent heterogeneity can result in high variability in the bird community at finer, transect scales, but increased diversity and stability at broad landscape scales.

On average, the particles from the forest fire were less light absorbing than those from the grass fires due to the longer duration of smouldering combustion in the forest biomass. CO and CH4 emission factors were over twice as high for the forest burn than for the grass burn, corresponding with a lower modified combustion efficiency and greater smouldering combustion. This dataset reveals the evolution of smoke emissions from two different commonly burned fuel types and demonstrates the complexity of emission factors. © IAWF 2016.","Aurell, J.; Gullett, B.; Holder, A.; Larkin, N.; Moore, M.; O'Neill, S.; Potter, B.; Rorig, M.; Strand, T.; Urbanski, S.","","25",2016,"black carbon; combustion efficiency; emissions factor; particulate matter; smoke","","","","","","","","",""

Consequentially, extant biodiversity can easily be overlooked. These cryptic species are often not recognized until genetic data are in hand, as is the case for the novel taxon we describe here. Carex viridistellata in Carex section Ceratocystis is an endemic species restricted to calcareous wetlands of Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, where it has previously been collected as Carex cryptolepis. Crosses between Carex viridistellata and Carex cryptolepis produce sterile F1 hybrids, and the two species are differentiated by a number of subtle morphological characters, as well as aspects of their respective ecologies. Phylogenetic analyses of nrDNA strongly indicate monophyly of Carex viridistellata and its sister species relationship with the North Carolina narrow endemic Carex lutea.

On a neighboring colony, we observed a second adult female ferret engaging in similar ambush behaviors on 12 occasions, although prey was not visible. We retrospectively assessed radio-telemetry data on white-tailed prairie dogs (C. leucurus) and a male and a female ferret to evaluate ferret activity in relation to timing of prairie dog emergence. Activity of radio-collared ferrets was high during the hourly period when prairie dogs first emerged and the following 2 hr, relative to later daylight hours.

Implications of our results for managing rangelands include the potential to (1) conserve native grasslands and shrublands that have not undergone large-scale reduction in composition of native plants; (2) control or eradicate exotic plants on native grasslands and shrublands where invasion potential or spread of exotics is highest; and (3) restore native plant communities by using intensive range practices where potential for restoration is highest. Our analysis also indicated that >70 percent of the 91 species are affected negatively by one or more factors associated with roads. Moreover, maps of the abundance of source habitats in relation to classes of road density suggested that road-associated factors hypothetically may reduce the potential to support persistent populations of terrestrial carnivores in many subbasins. Management implications of our summarized road effects include the potential to mitigate a diverse set of negative factors associated with roads. Comprehensive mitigation of road-associated factors would require a substantial reduction in the density of existing roads as well as effective control of road access in relation to management of livestock, timber, recreation, hunting, trapping, mineral development, and other human activities. A major assumption of our work was that validation research will be conducted by agency scientists and other researchers to corroborate our findings. As a preliminary step in the process of validation, we found high agreement between trends in source habitats and prior trends in habitat outcomes that were estimated as part of the habitat outcome analysis for terrestrial species within the basin.

Soil geomorphologists use key pedological properties to estimate ages of Quaternary deposits of various depositional environments, estimate long-term stability and instability of landscapes, and make inferences on past climatic change. Once the influence of the soil-forming factors is known, soils can be used to help interpret some aspects of landscape evolution that otherwise might go undetected. The Front Range of Colorado rises from the plains of the Colorado Piedmont at about 1700 m past a widespread, dissected Tertiary erosion surface between 2300 and 2800 m up to an alpine Continental Divide at 3600 to over 4000 m. Pleistocene valley glaciers reached the western edge of the erosion surface. Parent rocks are broadly uniform (granitic and gneissic). Climate varies from 46 cm mean annual precipitation (MAP) and 11 °C mean annual temperature (MAT) in the plains to 102 cm and -4 °C, respectively, near the range crest. Vegetation follows climate with grassland in the plains, forest in the mountains, and tundra above 3450 m. Soils reflect the bioclimatic transect from plains to divide: A/Bw or Bt/Bk or K (grassland) to A/E/Bw or Bt/C (forest) to A/Bw/C (tundra). Corresponding soil pH values decrease from 8 to less than 5 with increasing elevation. The pedogenic clay minerals dominant in each major vegetation zone are: smectite (grassland), vermiculite (forest), and 1.0-1.8 nm mixed-layer clays (tundra). Within the lower forested zone, the topographic factor (aspect) results in more leached, colder soils, with relatively thin O horizons, well-expressed E horizons and Bt horizons (Alfisols) on N-facing slopes, whereas soils with thicker A horizons, less developed or no E horizons, and Bw or Bt horizons (Mollisols) are more common on S-facing slopes. The topographic factor in the tundra results in soil patterns as a consequence of wind-redistributed snow and the amount of time it lingers on the landscape. An important parent material factor is airborne dust, which results in fine-grained surface horizons and, if infiltrated, contributes to clay accumulation in some Bt horizons. The time factor is evaluated by soil chronosequence studies of Quaternary deposits in tundra, upper forest, and plains grassland. Few soils in the study area are >10,000 years old in the tundra, >100,000 years old in the forest, and >2 million years old in the grassland. Stages of granite weathering vary with distance from the Continental Divide and the best developed is grus near the sedimentary/granitic rock contact just west of the mountain front. Grus takes a minimum of 100,000 years to form. Some of the relations indicated by the soil map patterns are: (1) parts of the erosion surface have been stable for 100,000 years or more; (2) development of grus near the mountain front could be due in part to pre-Pennsylvanian weathering; (3) a few soil properties reflect Quaternary paleoclimate; and (4) a correlation between soil development in the canyons and stream incision rates. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we analyzed data from 13 microsatellite loci and 298 bp of mitochondrial DNA in frogs collected from 23 of the remaining R. pretiosa populations in order to (1) assess levels of genetic diversity within populations of R. pretiosa, (2) identify the major genetic groups in the species, (3) estimate levels of genetic differentiation and gene flow among populations within each major group, and (4) compare the pattern of differentiation among R. pretiosa populations with that among populations of R. cascadae, a non-endangered congener that also occurs in Oregon and Washington. There is a strong, hierarchical genetic structure in R. pretiosa. That structure includes six major genetic groups, one of which is represented by a single remaining population. R. pretiosa populations have low genetic diversity (average He = 0.31) compared to R. cascadae (average He = 0.54) and to other ranid frogs. Genetic subdivision among populations is much higher in R. pretiosa than in R. cascadae, particularly over the largest geographic distances (hundreds of kilometers). A joint analysis of migration rates among populations and of effective sizes within populations (using MIGRATE) suggests that both species have extremely low migration rates, and that R. pretiosa have slightly smaller effective sizes. However, the slight difference in effective sizes between species appears insufficient to explain the large difference in genetic diversity and in large-scale genetic structure. We therefore hypothesize that low connectivity among the more widely-spaced R. pretiosa populations (owing to their patchier habitat), is the main cause of their lower genetic diversity and higher among-population differentiation. Conservation recommendations for R. pretiosa include maintaining habitat connectivity to facilitate gene flow among populations that are still potentially connected, and either expanding habitat or founding additional 'backup' populations to maintain diversity in the isolated populations. We recommend that special consideration be given to conservation of the Camas Prairie population in Northern Oregon. It is the most geographically isolated population, has the lowest genetic diversity (He = 0.14) and appears to be the only remaining representative of a major genetic group that is now almost extinct. Finally, because the six major groups within R. pretiosa are strongly differentiated, occupy different habitat types, and are geographically separate, they should be recognized as evolutionarily significant units for purposes of conservation planning. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Blouin, M.S.; Monsen, K.J.; Phillipsen, I.C.","","11",2010,"Amphibian declines; Evolutionarily significant unit; Gene flow; Genetic diversity; Pacific Northwest; Ranidae","","","","","","","","",""

The distribution of these vegetation types is controlled by specific environmental parameters, such as hydrologic regime, nutrient availability, disturbance level, substrate type, and salinity; ecotones between vegetation types may be sharp. Using R-mode cluster analysis of pollen data, we identified diagnostic species groupings; Q-mode cluster analysis was used to differentiate pollen signatures of each vegetation type. Cluster analysis and the modern analog technique were applied to interpret vegetational and environmental trends over the last two millennia at a site in Water Conservation Area 3A. The results show that close modern analogs exist for assemblages in the core and indicate past hydrologic changes at the site, correlated with both climatic and land-use changes.

Two large-scale controls of this climatic sequence can be inferred from paleoclimatic model experiments. The first is the effect of the Laurentide ice sheet on surface winds and temperatures; this influence was strongest prior to 9 ka. This control was replaced by the amplified seasonal cycle of solar radiation between 12 and 6 ka that increased summer temperature and net radiation and decreased effective moisture.

Palynological evidence from a number of sites in several southeastern states suggests that prairie-like vegetation was dominant in this region during the mid-Holocene, particularly; this is believed to be indicative of arid conditions during that time. Differences in the paleoclimate and vegetation would have had significant impacts on the landscape morphology of the Southeast. Evidence of these physical, environmental, and biological changes has been preserved at the McClelland sandpit site in southeastern Georgia. The depositional events recorded at the site were active during the mid-Holocene dry period known as the Hypsithermal. The flora of the site was characterized by prairie, or southern pine savannah. Two generations of pine trees are preserved at the McClelland site. These were inundated with coarse, angular quartz sand beginning around 7000 years ago. We hypothesize that this may have been the result of a stream channel that became avulsed, spilling its coarse bedload across the landscape. The site was finally covered by an essentially structureless aeolian dune deposit, the accumulation of which is consistent with coeval dune activity across the Southeast during the Hypsithermal. The most recent period of landscape evolution, which resulted in the burial of worked flint flakes, might have been approximately 2000-3000 years ago.","Newsom, L.; Rich, F.J.; Zayac, T.","","40",2001,"","","","","","","","","",""

As the total coverage of towns has declined, mean size of towns has decreased, and towns have become increasingly more isolated.

The organic deposits in Lamar Cave, Wyoming, are composed almost entirely of the decomposed collections of wood rats (Neotoma cinerea) and carnivores, mainly wolves (Canis lupus) and coyotes (Canis latrans). The fossil sample, whether analyzed by level or as the total site accumulation, more closely approximates the local living fauna than a modem raptor-pellet and camivore-scat collection does. The combination of taxa from all but 2 out of 16 levels unambiguously describes the mammalian community of the local sagebrush grassland. Absence of certain extralocal species clearly reflects lack of long-distance (>5 km) transport of non-sagebrush grassland species. If the aim of a paleontological study is specifically to reconstruct the local mammalian community, these data demonstrate that only a minimum of sampling effort may be required for similar localities. However, the data from Lamar Cave do demonstrate that if the goal of a paleontological, or in fact modern, study is to tally the total number of species, an intensive sampling effort is required in order to include the rare taxa. Though time-averaged records indeed may obscure some analyses, particularly those of discerning disharmonious faunas such as those found at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, this study shows that some time-averaging will benefit the interpretation of faunal diversity of both present and past ecosystems by inclusion of less common taxa.","Hadly, E.A.","","149",1999,"Community; Holocene; Mammals; Palaeontology; Taphonomy","","","","","","","","",""

One way to examine the relationship between vegetation and climate is to study the isotopic composition of organic carbon preserved in paleosols. Paleosols that preserve organic matter in the form of carbonaceous root traces provide direct evidence of the proportion of C 3 to C 4 biomass that grew in the soil, in contrast with pedogenic carbonate δ 13C values, which may also reflect complicating factors including mixing from atmospheric δ 13C in low productivity ecosystems. A high temporal and spatial resolution reconstruction of past ecosystems was derived from thirty-five paleosols in a thirty-four meter section of the Sixmile Creek Formation at Timber Hills, Montana (USA) that was deposited during the Miocene (10.2-8.9Ma ago). Phytoliths were extracted from paleosol samples to compare vegetation assemblages to inferences based on isotopic compositions, with both proxies giving similar results. Isotopic results from organic matter indicate both a small component of C 4 photosynthetic plants locally prior to their regional expansion to dominance in the late Miocene through the early Pleistocene, and large variation in the abundance of C 4 plants (0-25%) in this ecosystem both laterally and on a 100Kyr timescale. In contrast, pedogenic carbonate δ 13C values from this site indicate a high proportion of C 4 photosynthesis that is at odds with both phytolith and δ 13C org results, suggesting that the carbonate values are biased by diagenesis or diffusion of atmospheric CO 2, and that a similar issue may impact previous paleovegetation reconstructions based on pedogenic carbonates. Quantitative reconstructions of mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation indicate little local variability through time and that the fluctuations in C 4 proportion were not climatically driven. Instead, the variable proportion of C 4 photosynthesis is best explained by ecosystem-scale variables such as succession, fluvial avulsion, and fire regime. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Cotton, J.M.; Sheldon, N.D.","","337-338",2012,"C 4 photosynthesis; Paleoclimate; Paleosols; Stable isotope geochemistry","","","","","","","","",""

We test this idea by exploring if the encroachment of woody vegetation into grasslands in a carbonate terrain landscape at the Konza Prairie (KS, USA) has resulted in differences in landscape-stream connectivity and, thus, the behavior of stream water solutes. Woody encroachment (up to 60% cover) at Konza has been observed on watersheds, particularly those that experience a fire return interval of four years or greater. We focus on three headwater catchments (two grassland and one woody-encroached) and a downstream confluence, and analyze stream water discharge and chemistry (major anions, cations, and dissolved nutrients) measured from 2015 to 2016. We observe that the woody-encroached watershed exhibits a greater area-normalized solute flux and greater degree of chemodynamic behavior for most geogenic species compared to the less encroached grassland watersheds. The downstream confluence exhibits the most chemostatic behavior for these same solutes compared to the low order watersheds. We interpret the chemodynamic behavior of the woody-encroached watersheds to arise from a greater diversity of flow paths and solute sources that contribute to this stream. End member mixing analysis (EMMA) supports this hypothesis but also indicates a possible “missing” end member which we interpret to be solutes likely derived from clay weathering along limestone-mudstone boundaries. We invoke differences in rooting systems between grass and woody species to explain the differences in flow paths and solute generation between these headwater sites given that they sit adjacent to each other, dissect the same nearly horizontal (dip 0.1–0.21°NW) lithologic units, and experience the same climate. If these processes hold true at other sites, then the globally observed encroachment of woody vegetation into grasslands may deepen flow paths and enhance chemical weathering fluxes from ecosystems, and over long-time periods alter the trajectory of soil development and landscape evolution. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Dodds, W.K.; Hirmas, D.R.; Li, L.; Macpherson, G.L.; Stops, M.W.; Sullivan, P.L.","","527",2019,"Critical zone; End member mixing analysis; Karst; Woody encroachment","","","","","","","","",""

Prior to about 11. 2 cal. ka, most of these lakes and wetlands were interconnected to form glacial Lake Willobee, which apparently formed when a debris flow dammed the Shingobee River. Between 11. 2 and 8. 5 cal. ka, the level of Lake Willobee fell as a result of breaching of the dam, transforming the deep lake into the existing lakes and wetlands. Analyses of a 9-m core from Little Shingobee Lake (LSL-B), and lacustrine sediments under 3. 3 m of peat in a 17-m core from Little Shingobee Fen (LSF-10), show that the dominant components are allogenic clastic material, and endogenic CaCO3 and organic matter. In both cores almost all of the iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are incorporated in endogenic minerals, presumed to be X-ray amorphous oxyhydroxide minerals, that occur in significant quantities throughout the cores; almost no Fe and Mn are contributed from detrital aluminosilicate minerals. This suggests that, for most of the Holocene, the allogenic watershed contributions to lake chemistry were minor compared to the dissolved mineral load. In addition, prior to 3. 5 cal. ka, pollen zone boundaries coincide with large changes in lake-sediment mineralogy, indicating that both landscape and climate processes were linked to early- and mid-Holocene lake chemistry. The pollen time series, with sequential domination by spruce, pine, sagebrush-oak, birch-oak and, finally, white pine is typical of the region and reflects the changing location of the prairie-forest transition zone over time.

The first site is composed of several basins located in today's desert elevations with mesic north-facing and xeric south-facing hillslopes underlain by different lithological formations. The second site is a mountainous basin exhibiting vegetation gradients from shrublands in the lower elevations to grasslands and forests at higher elevations. All three land surface properties were found to have significant influences on the S-A and C- A relations, while the power-law exponents of the CADs for these properties did not show any significant deviations from the narrow range of universal scaling exponents reported in the literature. Among the three different surface properties we investigated, vegetation had the most profound impact on the catchment descriptors. In the S-A diagrams of the aspect-controlled ecosystems, we found steeper slopes in north-facing aspects than south-facing aspects for a given drainage area. In elevation-controlled ecosystems, forested landscapes exhibited the steepest slopes for the range of drainage areas examined, followed by shrublands and grasslands in all soil textures and lithologies. In the C-A diagrams, steeper slopes led to a higher degree of divergence on hillslopes and a higher degree of convergence in the valleys than shallower slopes. The influence of functional types of vegetation detected on observed topography provided some initial understanding of the potential impacts of life on the organization of topography.

In the western United States, Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch wheatgrass; Poaceae) is an important component of grassland and shrubland plant communities and commonly used for restoration due to its drought resistance and competitiveness with exotic weeds. We used next-generation sequencing data to investigate the processes that shaped P. spicata's geographic pattern of genetic variation across the Intermountain West. Pseudoroegneria spicata's genetic diversity is partitioned into populations that likely differentiated since the Last Glacial Maximum. Adjacent populations display varying magnitudes of historical gene flow, with migration rates ranging from multiple migrants per generation to multiple generations per migrant. When considering the commercial germplasm sources available for restoration, genetic identities remain representative of the wildland localities from which germplasm sources were originally developed, and they maintain high levels of heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity. However, the commercial germplasm sources represent a small fraction of the overall genetic diversity of P. spicata in the Intermountain West. Given the low migration rates and long divergence times between some pairs of P. spicata populations, using commercial germplasm sources could facilitate undesirable restoration outcomes when used in certain geographic areas, even if the environment in which the commercial materials thrive is similar to that of the restoration site. As such, population structure and history can be used to provide guidance on what geographic areas may need additional native plant materials so that restoration efforts support species and community resilience and improve outcomes.

Many of the ecotypic adaptations are related to water availability in the native environment. Stomates facilitate photosynthetic gas exchange and regulate water loss from the plant. As such, stomatal size and density represent possible adaptations to conserve water. We hypothesized drought-tolerant ecotypes of big bluestem would have fewer or smaller stomates compared to more mesic ecotypes. Five ecotypes of big bluestem were planted in four common gardens from western Kansas to southern Illinois, USA to determine genetic and environmental influences on stomates. Leaves of all ecotypes of A. gerardii were largely hypostomatous and genetics was a greater influence than environment for stomatal size and density. The drought-tolerant Sand bluestem had larger stomates on abaxial surfaces of leaves, but a lower density compared to most other ecotypes. The most mesic Illinois ecotype and the Kaw cultivar had the greatest density of stomates on abaxial surfaces of leaves. Sand Bluestem had a greater density of stomates on adaxial surfaces of leaves compared to all other ecotypes. Gas exchange measures followed patterns of stomate distribution, where abaxial CO2 uptake rates were greater than adaxial CO2 uptake rates, although differences between leaf surfaces was more pronounced in stomatal density than in CO2 uptake. There were minor differences in size and density of stomates among sites that corresponded with precipitation, although these differences were minor, illustrating the genetic underpinnings of stomates in big bluestem. There is a genetic predisposition for drought-tolerant ecotypes to have fewer stomates, illustrating an evolutionary adaptation to drought tolerance in an important prairie species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Baer, S.G.; Galliart, M.; Hilt, C.J.; Johnson, L.C.; Maricle, B.R.; Varvel, N.A.","","155",2018,"Big bluestem; Common gardens; Ecotypes; Gas exchange; Sand bluestem; Stomata","","","","","","","","",""

In plants, selection towards early flowering is commonly observed. Pollinator-mediated selection is hypothesized to be a pervasive evolutionary force acting directionally on flowering time. However, pollinator-mediated mechanisms have rarely been tested in realistic field conditions, especially in perennial plants visited by a diversity of generalist insect pollinators. We examined pollinator visitation in eight Echinacea angustifolia populations in western Minnesota, USA, to gauge the potential for pollinator-mediated selection. Echinacea is a common prairie perennial that persists in isolated remnant populations. Echinacea is self-incompatible and is pollinated by a diversity of generalist solitary bees. A previous study found that early flowering Echinacea plants have higher seed set and their reproduction is less pollen-limited than late flowering plants. Twelve times throughout a flowering season, we quantified pollinator visitation rates and pollinator community composition. In three sites, we also estimated the quality of pollinator visits by examining the composition of pollinators’ pollen loads brought to Echinacea plants. We found that three aspects of pollination dramatically decreased over the course of the flowering season. 1) Pollinators visited early flowering plants more frequently than late flowering plants. 2) The pollinator community was also less diverse late in the flowering season and became dominated by a single species of small bee, Augochlorella aurata. 3) Pollinators visiting Echinacea late in the season carried proportionally less conspecific pollen compared to pollinators visiting Echinacea early in the flowering season. Understanding within-season dynamics of pollination helps predict the prevalence of inbreeding, phenological assortative mating, and reproductive failure, especially in fragmented plant populations. © 2018 The Authors","Ison, J.L.; Nordstrom, S.W.; Prescott, L.J.; Waananen, A.; Wagenius, S.","","127",2018,"Echinacea angustifolia; flowering phenology; fragmentation; mate limitation; plant–pollinator interactions; pollinator-mediated mechanisms; temporal mating patterns","","","","","","","","",""

Given their biphasic life cycle, pond-breeding amphibians provide a natural system for studying DLHEs, although these effects are not restricted to species with biphasic life histories. In this study, we used multiple mark-recapture techniques enabled by a large trapping array to monitor components of fitness and resulting DLHEs in a population of the endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense). We found that DLHEs are prominent across all life stage transitions and that there is variation in whether selection acts primarily at the individual or cohort level. We also demonstrated that there is more than an order of magnitude variation in mean cohort fitness, providing tremendous variation for DLHEs to act upon. We documented an evolutionary trade-off between mass at emergence and date of emergence, which may play a role in maintaining the variation in mass (fitness) at emergence. A literature review revealed that such high levels of intercohort variation occur in many other pond-breeding amphibians, and that appropriately documenting the magnitude of intercohort variation requires long-term studies (roughly two population turnovers). Given the profound effect that DLHEs can have on population dynamics, quantifying intercohort variation in mean fitness and the level(s) at which selection acts will be very important for developing accurate models of population dynamics. In general, when developing models of population dynamics, more attention should be paid to variation in mean fitness and not just variation in total numbers. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","Gray, L.N.; Searcy, C.A.; Shaffer, H.B.; Trenham, P.C.","","95",2014,"Ambystoma californiense; California; California tiger salamander; Contextual analysis; Date of emergence; Intercohort variation; Jepson Prairie Preserve; Mass at emergence; Pondbreeding amphibian; Population turnover; Selection gradient; USA","","","","","","","","",""

(updated)","An updated review of biological information is provided for Avena fatua. A widespread species originating in Eurasia, A. fatua is one of the 10 worst annual weeds of temperate agricultural regions of the world. Key weediness traits of this highly selfing species include fecundity, seed shatter, and a large and persistent seed bank with variable degrees of primary seed dormancy. The species occurs in all Canadian provinces and most states in the USA. In Canada, it is most troublesome as a weed in the prairies, where it has spread throughout crop areas in all climatic zones. Depending upon plant density and relative time of emergence, A. fatua competition may reduce annual crop yields by as much as 70%. First cohort emergence of A. fatua coincides with planting and emergence of spring-seeded crops, although additional cohorts can emerge throughout the growing season. Avena fatua is more abundant in zerothan intensive-tillage systems; the former regime promotes earlier and greater emergence because of a shallower and less persistent seed bank. Despite the introduction of highly efficacious herbicides in the 1970s and 1980s, abundance of the species has not declined across the Canadian prairies or elsewhere. The continual evolution of herbicide-resistant A. fatua populations, seed spread via farm machinery, and limited herbicide modes of action for its control threaten sustained annual field crop production in many temperate agricultural areas. Further adoption and integration of multiple non-herbicidal weed management practices, such as enhanced crop seeding rate, competitive crops and cultivars, and precision fertilizer placement, should help mitigate A. fatua interference. The species has some beneficial uses as an alternative feed and food constituent or industrial feedstock, as well as potential in cultivated oat (Avena sativa L.) improvement.","Beckie, H.J.; Francis, A.; Hall, L.M.","","92",2012,"Avena fatua; Folle avoine; Weed biology; Wild oat","","","","","","","","",""

Holocene and Pleistocene meander belts have similar landscape morphologies, lithofacies, and soil characteristics, and probably formed under similar hydrologic regimes. The Pleistocene Avoyelles Prairie meander belt is now terraced, but it was originally graded to a lower relative sea-level position than the Holocene flood plain. Holocene alluvial soils are generally weakly expressed cumulative profiles with abundant redoximorphic features, and formed on an aggrading flood plain with a shallow fluctuating water table. The soil morphology varies with respect to landscape position and overbank lithofacies. Pleistocene alluvial paleosols show evidence for two stages of pedogenesis. During the first stage of pedogenesis, water-table fluctuations and flood-plain aggradation produced profiles with color mottles, iron and carbonate nodules, and weak B and C horizons, similar to Holocene flood-plain soils. The second stage of pedogenesis occurred after the Avoyelles Prairie was terraced and the regional water table fell a minimum of 30 m. Improved soil drainage created oxidizing and acidic conditions, removed free carbonates, dehydrated iron oxides, and transformed clay minerals. This stage produced Pleistocene profiles with brighter matrix and mottle hues, lower pH values, larger and harder iron nodules, and greater kaolinite contents than comparable Holocene flood-plain soils. The primary influence on regional water table lowering in the southern Lower Mississippi Valley was relative sea-level fall. Mississippi River flood-plain lowering adjacent to the Avoyelles Prairie most likely occurred between the end of oxygen isotope stage 3 and the maximum period of valley entrenchment, during oxygen isotope stage 2. Water-table fall affected pedogenic processes a minimum of 400 km upvalley of the continental shelf margin. Pleistocene Mississippi River paleosols represent excellent analogs for interpreting ancient alluvial paleosols formed during episodes of base-level fall and valley incision. As fluvial entrenchment terraced the meandering Avoyelles Prairie, a pedogenic threshold was crossed that altered the pathway of chemical weathering. The complexity of a multiple-step pedogenic history also highlights the fact that interpretation of relative profile development as a function of time can be problematic.","Aslan, A.; Autin, W.J.","","113",2001,"Alluvial soils; Fluvial sediments; Louisiana; Lower Mississippi Valley; Paleosols","","","","","","","","",""

Finer-resolution satellite data and ground studies are needed to understand the changes in the vegetation that are causing these increases. Analysis of an 823 km2 area using a Landsat NDVI time series showed that the homogeneous greening at coarser scales was very heterogeneous at 30-m pixel resolution, with a strong influence due to glacial history. Small scattered patches of pixels with significant increases in NDVI occurred throughout the younger, late Pleistocene glacial deposits. On older, mid-Pleistocene deposits, increases occurred in few, larger patches of mostly tussock-sedge, dwarf-shrub, moss tundra, possibly a result of release of nutrients from thawing of ice-rich permafrost. Five percent of pixels had significant linear increases in NDVI from 1985 to 2007 (n = 6, p &lt; 0.05), while 0.4% showed significant decreases, in small patches whose causes were evident when sampled on the ground. Trends in NDVI varied by glacial history, elevation, slope, and the resulting vegetation conditions.

In Hungary, fires might have played an important role in maintaining the openness of the forest steppe on the Hungarian Great Plain during the early Holocene. Recently, fires pose a threat to certain habitats, such as Austrian pine plantations and juniper-poplar steppe woodlands. Furthermore, under a warmer, dryer and more variable climate projected for the near future, fire risk in general is expected to increase. During the last two decades, numerous, mostly foreign studies reported that smoke derived from burning vegetation and its aqueous solution (smoke-water) had beneficial effects on the regeneration of a range of species. Here we review the main results of these studies on the prevalence, physiological mechanism, ecological significance and potential for practical use of this phenomenon, and highlight the importance of such investigations in Hungary. To date, smoke or smoke-water has been shown to stimulate seed germination for more than 1200 species from phylogenetically distant plant families and different continents. The phenomenon is particularly frequent in Mediterranean shrublands, for both dicotyledons and monocotyledons, annuals and perennials, but it has also been recorded for species from non-fire prone semi-deserts, numerous arable weeds and cultivated plants. Based on literature data, enhanced germination in response to the active compounds of smoke has been detected for about half (33) of 65 natural species in the Hungarian flora and for 8 cultivated plants, while negative effects were found for 7 species (10%) only. In addition, smoke can improve seedling growth and vigour, and promote flowering and fruiting. The most probable mechanism of smoke action is that it performs similar functions than endogenous plant growth regulators do or interacts with these hormones, and/or induces stress-like responses similar to that of certain environmental stresses (e.g. drought or temperature extremes). The germination stimulating capacity is mainly attributed to karrikinolide (3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one, KAR1), a butenolide-type compound identified in smoke. The aqueous solution of KAR1 is effective over a wide range of concentrations (from 10-4 to 10-9 M) for many species. Further studies are needed to assess the significance of the promotive effects of smoke in the composition and structure of plant communities (e.g. diversity, invasive species, fungal colonization of roots) during postfire succession. The beneficial effects of smoke and smoke-water enable the application of smoke-technology in conservation (e.g. habitat restoration, ex-situ conservation of threatened species) and cultivation of several crops and vegetables with lower costs and smaller impacts on the environment.","Kalapos, T.; Mojzes, A.","","10",2012,"Fire; Germination; Karrikinolide; Review; Seedling vigour; Smoke-water","","","","","","","","",""

The widest studied events have been the Missoula and Altai floods with 300–700 m flow depth, 1–20 m bedform height and 10–300 m wavelength. Nowadays, the Saint-Venant equations have succeeded at simulating the catastrophic glacial-lake drainage process numerically, but we still lack a depth-averaged morphodynamic theory able to predict the growth of dunes and antidunes. The disparity of spatial scales in megafloods prevents the use of non-depth-averaged rotational flow equations, motivating the present shallow-water theory for the formation of megaflood-scale bedforms. We adopt a non-equilibrium sediment transport equation rooted in Einstein's pioneering work. Here we prove that the bed instability triggers to form dunes and antidunes simply by lagging the entrainment term for sediment mass conservation, or the bottom shear stress, with respect to the depth-averaged flow velocity. We formalise this result using a linear stability theory that captures the existence regions of dune and antidune in addition to the roll wave instability. Furthermore, in the spirit of Kennedy (Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., vol. 1, 1969, pp. 147–168), we derive a closed-form solution of growth rate and wave speed of the bedform. The nondimensional groups controlling the linear instabilities are the Froude number, ℱr, the Shields parameter, Sh, and the grain roughness relative to flow depth, d. Subsequently, we simulate the drainage of the largest Missoula flood numerically to explain the formation of giant antidunes in the Camas Prairie (Montana, US) during the late stage of the megaflood. Also considered are large fields of gravel dunes in the Kuray-Chuja Lake Basin (Altai Mountains, Siberia). The simulated hydraulic conditions over bedforms in both basins yield values of the nondimensional parameters that lie in the theoretical region of dunes and antidunes according to the proposed theory and in situ measurements in sandy rivers and flume experiments. © 2019","Bohorquez, P.; Cañada-Pereira, P.; Jimenez-Ruiz, P.J.; del Moral-Erencia, J.D.","","193",2019,"Dune and antidune; Linear stability theory; Missoula and Altai Quaternary flood; Sediment transport","","","","","","","","",""

The early-Holocene pollen assemblage is dominated by Cupressaceae (>40%), Pinus (>20%), Quercus (5-20%), Artemisia (> 15%), and Sarcobatus (>5%), suggesting pinyon-juniper-oak woodland in the uplands, with greasewood on the saltflats near the lake. Giant sequoia was widespread along the Sierra Nevada streams draining into Tulare Lake, prior to 9000 yr B.P. as Sequoiadendron pollen is greater than 4%. The pollen assemblages before 18,500 yr B.P. are similar to those of the early Holocene (Cupressaceae, Artemisia, and Sarcobatus), but a gap in sedimentation from ca. 18,500-10,500 yr B.P. prohibits characterization of full-glacial vegetation. The end of Great Basin-like pollen assemblages 7000 yr B.P. (demise of Sarcobatus) coincides with increased frequency of charcoal; i.e., greater fire frequency in the Holocene woodland and grassland. From 7000-4000 yr B.P. the pollen assemblage is dominated by Other Compositae and Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthus pollen, suggesting expansion of xerophytic steppe at the expense of oak woodland. Higher percentages of littoral pollen (Cyperaceae, Typha-Sparganium) and lower percentages of pelagic algae (Botryococcus + Pediastrum) during the middle Holocene indicate lake levels generally lower than during the early Holocene.

Three hypotheses for the origin of parks are proposed. The 'permanent site hypothesis' states that the park-forest vegetation mosaic is a result of differences in physical characteristics of sites. In the 'remnant hypothesis' parks are thought to be remnants of vegetation that was widespread under previous climate conditions. The 'replacement hypothesis' states that parks replace forest vegetation in response to disturbance, climate change, or a combination of these two factors. Patterns in the past distribution of park and forest vegetation in the vicinity of Fish Creek Park (elevation 2750 m) were used to test these hypotheses. Fossil pollen extracted from the sediments of five small ponds in and around Fish Creek Park was used to reconstruct Holocene vegetation changes. Changes in vegetation were reconstructed through the use of multivariate analyses and pollen ratios derived from modern surface samples and by comparison with pollen data from other studies. The pollen record indicates that shortly after deglaciation (~ 11 000 yr BP) the area supported alpine tundra, followed by whitebark pine-spruce-fir parkland at ~9500 yr BP. From ~8500 to 6000 yr BP, a pine parkland occupied the area, perhaps in response to climate conditions warmer than today. By 5000 yr BP a mixed pine-spruce-fir forest resembling the modern subalpine forest near Fish Creek Park probably replaced the pine parkland at all five sites. The modern park vegetation originated only within the last ~2500 yr. The conversion to park vegetation may not have been synchronous at all three sites, and the replacement of forest by park did not always result in a long-term conversion to park vegetation. The timing and pattern of changes in the vegetation mosaic eliminate the permanent site and remnant hypotheses and suggest instead that climatic cooling over the last several thousand years, possibly combined with removal of forest cover by fire or some other disturbance, could explain the origin of Fish Creek Park.","Lynch, E.A.","","79",1998,"Climate change; Palynology; Park; Quaternary paleoecology; Vegetation mosaic; Wind River Range; Wyoming","","","","","","","","",""

This research presents a paleoecological history of Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) in MN, USA, spanning the last ~8000 years. The objectives of this study were to use charcoal, pollen, and magnetic susceptibility of lake sediments collected from Johnson Slough (JS) within the refuge to evaluate the natural range of variability and disturbance history of the oak savanna within the refuge, assess the success of current restoration strategies, and add to the regional paleoecological history. The mid/late Holocene period of the JS record shows a period of high fire activity from ca. 6500 to 2600 cal year BP, with a shift from prairie to oak savanna occurring over this same period. A (possibly agricultural) disturbance to JS sediments affected the period from ca. 2600 cal year BP to 1963 AD, which includes the time of Euro–American settlement. However, the destruction and subsequent restoration of the oak savanna is evident in a pollen ratio of Quercus:Poaceae, indicating that current restoration efforts have been successful at restoring the oak savanna to within the natural range of variability seen just prior to destruction. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Brunelle, A.; Hepola, T.; Spencer, J.D.","","60",2017,"Holocene; Land management; Oak savanna; Paleoecology; Pollen; Restoration","","","","","","","","",""

In a colony of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) in South Dakota, badgers concentrated their activities where burrow openings and prairie dogs were abundant, a selective behavior that was exhibited by ferrets in the same colony. Badgers excavated burrows more often when in areas recently used by a ferret, suggesting that badgers hunt ferrets or steal prey from ferrets, or both. We also conducted an analysis of survival studies for ferrets and Siberian polecats (M. eversmanii) released onto prairie dog colonies.

An earlier study ascribed a purely physical origin for these soil features based on a four-stage conceptual model. Mounds were interpreted as periglacially produced clay domes formed in polygonal ground and stone perimeters as loose gravity accumulations in unexplained shallow trenches at dome peripheries. The model was widely cited to account for similar stone-bordered prairie mounds and rubbly soil intermounds in the Pacific Northwest. Our observations and measurements indicate, however, that these mounded landscapes are more complex, and that a polygenetic origin best explains them. We suggest that combined bioturbation, seasonal frost action, and erosion processes, with occasional eolian inputs, best account for the mounds, their well sorted stone borders, and the poorly sorted rubbly soil intermound pavements. We propose a transitional, eight-stage conceptual model to explain this complex landscape. The model may generally explain the origin of other similar strongly bioturbated, cold winter-impacted, erosion-prone mounded tracts in the Pacific Northwest. © 2012 The Geological Society of America.

Paleovalley-fill facies consist of gravelly and sandy braided-stream deposits interbedded with and overlain by eolian sediments deposited as sand sheets and loess. Uplands on the pre-Ogallala erosional surface are overlain primarily by similar eolian sediments. Calcic paleosols, consisting mostly of glaebules and rhizoconcretions of CaCO 3 , occur throughout the eolian facies. Massive to laminated and locally pisolitic, brecciated, and recemented pedogenic calcretes occur primarily near or at the top of the Ogallala Formation. Eolian facies preserve numerous superposed calcretes and calcic paleosols, reflecting slow episodic aggradation on a savanna or grassland under and to subhumid climatic conditions. The change from fluvial to mostly eolian sedimentation probably resulted from diversion of streams that deposited fluvial sediments of the Ogallala Formation to form the Pecos and Canadian rivers.

Slow recovery rates for pinyon and juniper and inadequate mensuration data present significant obstacles to predictive management efforts. Many National Forest districts have witnessed continued fuel use for at least the past 100 years. To explore the need for long-term analysis at the district level, we have developed FORMAN I, a computer simulation written in FORTRAN IV that models prolonged fuel harvesting and its impact on pinyon-juniper woodlands. The technique is well-suited for historical analyses and we comply with an initial application that involves the suggested impact of prehistoric peoples on a marginal woodland in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. To accentuate the significance of the simulation, we have deliberately overestimated woodland parameters while maintaining conservative annual rates for firewood procurement. A low-density woodland (less than 14.8 cords/ha) is completely depleted within 200 years when subjected to tenth-through-twelfth century estimates of human demography for the canyon. Interesting conclusions are drawn from the lack of pinyon-juniper recovery at Chaco over the past millennium.

Evidences of such currents include commensurate, but otherwise ordinary, effects of streams confined to rocky channels and the unique giant ripple marks. At its high stage the lake is roughly estimated to have held more than 500 cubic miles of water of which nearly three-fourths was stored above a constricted part of the Clark Fork Valley called the Eddy Narrows. Calculations based on available incomplete data indicate a flow through the Eddy Narrows that reached a maximum of 9.46 cubic miles per hour. Whether the lake was completely drained at that time has not been determined, but a later set of beaches testifies that the basin held a lake soon after the rapid outflow.

Deep Lake became enriched in 18O in response to increased influence of maritime tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico between 12 000 and 9500cal BP culminating in regional expansion of Pinus and Quercus, and then again as a result of increased aridity with the establishment of more zonal circulation and prairie vegetation by 8500cal BP. Summer lake water temperatures simultaneously increased during the deglacial-Holocene transition, as suggested by decoupling of carbonate δ 18O and cellulose-inferred lake water δ 18O values between 11,000 and 9500cal BP, and then declined briefly around 8600cal BP, possibly in response to the cooling event associated with the final drainage of Glacial Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway into the Labrador Sea. Although the carbonate-cellulose paleothermometer generated unrealistically high values, these can readily be explained by imposing kinetic effects that occur during rapid carbonate precipitation and conservative estimates of a seasonal lag effect in the synthesis of cellulose with respect to carbonate.

Extinctions of Arctotertiary woody taxa are recorded during the Early and Middle Pleistocene, but glacial refugia facilitated the survival of a number of temperate, Mediterranean and Ibero-North African woody angiosperms. The responses of Iberian vegetation to climatic changes during the Pleistocene have been spatially and temporarily complex, including rapid changes of vegetation in parallel to orbital and suborbital variability, and situations of multi-centennial resilience or accommodation to climatic changes. Regional characteristics emerged as soon as for the Middle Pleistocene, if not earlier: Ericaceae in the Atlantic coast indicating wetter climate, thermo-mediterranean elements in the south as currently, and broad-leaf trees in the northeastern. Overall, steppe landscapes and open Pinus woodlands prevailed over many continental regions during the cold spells of the Late Pleistocene. The maintenance of a high phytodiversity during the glacials was linked to several refuge zones in the coastal shelves of the Mediterranean and intramountainous valleys.

Argillic soils are not mapped in well-drained positions on the youngest drift prairie landscapes. Roughly half of 47 pedons examined at a precision farming research site in Barnes County, North Dakota show evidence of genetic argillic horizons based on soil structure, hand texturing, and cutan presence. This study applies physical and micromorphological evidence to verify that diagnostic argillic horizons have formed in well-drained settings on this eastern North Dakota landscape. Total clay distributions and fine/total clay ratios show marked increases in genetic argillic horizons compared with surface horizons and parent materials. The argillic horizons average about 28 cm in thickness; only two pedons were thinner than 7.5 cm. Consequently, the increase in total clay and fine day distributions, and the thickness criteria required to meet diagnostic horizon status as established by Soil Taxonomy are satisfied. The upper argillic horizon boundary of seven profiles was 50 cm or more below the surface, possibly indicating relict argillic horizons. Micromorphologic evidence shows the presence of illuvial day in the three soils sampled for microscopy. Porosity variations caused by the argillic horizons likely affect subsurface flow and may be responsible for variable N levels measured for these soils.

Oval plane outlines with dominantly near-parallel long axes characterize the dunes. Maximum dune length is 600 m, width 400 m, and height 10m. The dune sand is uniformly medium grained, mostly very well and well sorted and has predominantly near-symmetrical skewnesses; 2 to 13 percent of the 0.25 mm grains are rounded and well rounded. Surprisingly, no internal stratification is evident in the dunes, possibly due to reworking by biological activity during slow sand accumulation by westerly winds. The climate of dune formation was probably somewhat cooler and considerably drier than the present wet subtropical conditions. Until now the Prairie and other Pleistocene coastwise terrace deposits along the Gulf of Mexico were generally accepted as interglacial formations. New evidence suggests that the dunes, the Prairie terrace surface, and at least the upper section of the Prairie Formation in the study area, may be of Early Wisconsin (glacial) age.

Yet questions remain about the role of plant phylogenetic diversity in generating and maintaining herbivore diversity, and whether evolutionary relatedness of producers might predict the composition of consumer communities. We tested for evidence of evolutionary associations among arthropods and the plants on which they were found, using phylogenetic analysis of naturally occurring arthropod assemblages sampled from a plant-diversity manipulation experiment. Considering phylogenetic relationships among more than 900 arthropod consumer taxa and 29 plant species in the experiment, we addressed several interrelated questions. First, our results support the hypothesis that arthropod functional traits such as body size and trophic role are phylogenetically conserved in community ecological samples. Second, herbivores tended to cooccur with closer phylogenetic relatives than would be expected at random, whereas predators and parasitoids did not show phylogenetic association patterns. Consumer specialization, as measured by association through time with monocultures of particular host plant species, showed significant phylogenetic signal, although the strength of this association varied among plant species. Polycultures of phylogenetically dissimilar plant species supported more phylogenetically dissimilar consumer communities than did phylogenetically similar polycultures. Finally, we separated the effects of plant species richness and relatedness in predicting the phylogenetic distribution of the arthropod assemblages in this experiment. The phylogenetic diversity of plant communities predicted the phylogenetic diversity of herbivore communities even after accounting for plant species richness. The phylogenetic diversity of secondary consumers differed by guild, with predator phylogenetic diversity responding to herbivore relatedness, while parasitoid phylogenetic diversity was driven by plant relatedness. Evolutionary associations between plants and their consumers are apparent in plots only meters apart in a single field, indicating a strong role for host-plant phylogenetic diversity in sustaining landscape consumer biodiversity. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.","Borer, E.T.; Cavender-Bares, J.; Lind, E.M.; Vincent, J.B.; Weiblen, G.D.","","96",2015,"Arthropod phylogeny; Cedar Creek LTER Minnesota USA; Community phylogenetics; Diversity; Grassland; Herbivores; Parasitoids; Predators","","","","","","","","",""

The high erosion rates in this region are caused by the unique combination of tectonic setting, geology, land use, and climate. This rapidly eroding region is located adjacent to the seismically active triple junction of three crustal plates near Cape Mendocino, California; late Tertiary and Quaternary underthrusting along the continental margin has caused recent (post-mid-Miocene) uplift (Silver, 1971). The area is underlain by the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic Franciscan assemblage, which is a deformed, faulted, locally sheared, and in part metamorphosed accumulation of continental-margin deposits. These deposits consist of intermixed units of melange and more coherent sandstones. The melange consists of an intensely sheared matrix of siltstone or sandy siltstone in which are dispersed large blocks and smaller boulders of sandstone, metasandstone, greenstone, chert, blueschist, and greenschist. Before European settlement, the area was vegetated with redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and interior expanses of grassland and grass-oak woodland. Since 1870, the region has undergone progressively more intensive land use. Cattle and sheep grazing on the prairies became widespread by the 1870's, and harvesting of redwood in the lower basin started in the late 1880's. Extensive harvesting of Douglas fir commenced on private lands in the middle and upper portions of the basin after World War II and continued until the mid-sixties. The region has high annual rainfall (125 to 300 cm) that occurs almost entirely between October and April. Between two and six intense rainstorms each winter furnish the streamflows that transport the majority of the annual sediment yield. An important climatic feature is the occurrence at intervals of 100 to 500 yr of storms of extreme intensity and duration that may be responsible for much of the erosion in the region. One such storm occurred in December of 1964. All of the above features, the climate, tectonic setting, geology, vegetation, and land-use history, probably contribute to the high erosion rate of the region. In order to reach some understanding of the relative contributions of these factors and of how sediment moves through the watershed in this region, a detailed analysis was undertaken of the processes and distribution of erosion and deposition in the upper 575 km 2 of the 1,111-km 2 Van Duzen River basin (Kelsey, 1977). The Van Duzen is the northernmost tributary of the Eel River in north coastal California, and flows into the Eel 22 km upstream of its mouth (Fig. 1). Field work for the study took place in 1973-1976. In addition, six sets of aerial photos covering the basin from 1941 through 1975 are available, and stream-gaging records for a U.S. Geological Survey gaging station at the downstream end of the study area near Bridgeville, California, have been available since 1951. A study of changes recognizable in the aerial photographs and interpretation of stream-gaging data for 1940-1975 and sediment discharge data for the periods 1956-1967 and 1975-1976 make possible an analysis of erosion and sedimentation for the 35-yr period, 1941-1975.

Rapid growth of the field in the present decade has exposed important and occasionally provocative evidence regarding climates of the Pleistocene in arid America. While much remains to be learned about the limitations of pollen analysis, the presence of abundant fossil pollen and spores in a variety of sediments, including playa lake mud, alluvium, cave earth, archaeological trash, and prehistoric coprolite, ensures increasing use of the method in future paleoecological investigation. From the pollen content of drill cores it appears that prior to Wisconsin glaciation climatic changes corresponding to the advance and retreat of continental glaciers are not easily recognized. Present difficulties may be overcome as our knowledge grows, but the pollen-stratigraphic record of the longest and most thoroughly studied drill core examined to date, that of Clisby and Sears from the San Augustin Plains, is not easily correlated climatically with multiple glaciation. The difficulties with climatic correlation do not extend into the Wisconsin, where there is a carbon-dated maximum in biotic-zone depression of 900-1,200 m about 20,000 years ago that corresponds to the maximum in Wisconsin ice advance recognized in the eastern United States. Furthermore, the Rich Lake Interpluvial in the Llano Estacado of Texas appears to correspond with the Plum Point Interstadial of the eastern United States. Earlier stadialinterstadial climatic fluctuations can be recognized in the pollen record of Wisconsin-age drill cores. The carbon-dated full-glacial pollen records suggest a vegetation pattern considerably altered from that of the present and one that must have imposed many changes in plant and animal distributions. A change to warm-dry postglacial climates appears to have occurred rather rapidly around 12,000 <sc>b.p</sc>. Except perhaps in the High Plains of Texas, the shift from full-glacial to postglacial climates is not clearly marked by late-glacial fluctuations, and no Valders or Younger-Dryas-age return of pluvial climates is evident. Postglacial alluvium of the desert grassland shows sharp changes in composite and cheno-am proportions, changes likely to be related to episodes of arroyo cutting and filling. In juniper-pifion areas of northern Arizona and New Mexico fluctuations in the tree-pollen record include a major rise in tree pollen coincident with or following abandonment of many Southwestern villages 700-500 years ago. Evidence for an Altithermal drought, which is supported by reduction in tree-pollen counts in profiles from the Great Basin, the Central Rockies, and the Pacific Northwest, is not evident in southern Arizona and New Mexico, where mid-postglacial spectra may contain more rather than less tree pollen. The widely held concept of Altithermal drought in the Southwest is theoretically questionable, and some of the Altithermal phenomena, such as intense arroyo cutting and calichification, may reflect an intensified summer monsoon. While pre-Pleistocene climatic change is widely recognized as responsible for the origin of arid-land plants, some of which can be traced to the Late Miocene, it now seems likely that many, perhaps all, Southwestern plants and animals were on the move in the Pleistocene. Certainly climatic change in the Wisconsin glacial period must have transformed the range of many species. Broken distributions in the range of boreal or Cordilleran plant and animal populations can be attributed to full-glacial invasion from the north ending 14,000 years ago. The postglacial return of desert, grassland, and Mexican woodland communities took place within the last 12,000 years, some species apparently ""overshooting"" to leave relict outposts or hybrid populations considerably to the north of the main range of the species. In the Southwest, as elsewhere in the New World, the extinction of elephants, native horses, camels, sloths, and other large vertebrates is a major event of the Late Pleistocene. Evidently it occurred at least 1,000 years after the change to warm, dry postglacial climates. Generic extinction is not seen in the Late Pleistocene record of plants, invertebrates, or small vertebrates; these endured intact. While doubt remains regarding the association of Early Man and certain of the extinct vertebrates, it appears that most of the large herbivores were hunted by Early Man, whose culture was drastically altered by their disappearance and who may be held responsible for the Late Pleistocene ""age of overkill."" © 1965, by Princeton University Press.","Martin, P.S.; Mehringer, P.J.","","",2015,"","","","","","","","","",""

Our analysis highlights the spatial–temporally dynamic nature of barrier island upland land area and vegetation, with rapidly changing ecosystem states. Over the time period, upland vegetation was dramatically reduced by 29% whereas woody vegetation cover increased 40% across all islands. Although conversions between sand, grassland, and woody vegetation were variable within each island, three major patterns of vegetative land-cover change were apparent: overall loss of vegetative cover, frequent transitions between grass and woody cover, and gain in woody cover. These patterns are valuable for understanding natural evolution of barrier islands in response to sea-level rise. Evaluation of temporal dynamics in barrier upland is needed to characterize underlying processes including island resilience or chronic stress, and is a prerequisite to sustainable coastal management- and resilience-based planning, especially when implementing ecosystem-based solutions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bissett, S.; Dows, B.; Manley, P.; Shiflett, S.A.; Via, S.; Young, D.R.; Zinnert, J.C.","","19",2016,"LTER; coastal vegetation; remote sensing; sea-level rise; state change; woody expansion","","","","","","","","",""

Second, we calculate an index of hierarchical imbalance of abundances at the clade level encapsulating the distribution of individuals across the nodes in the phylogeny.

The invaded regions are characterized by highly differentiated populations of B. distachyon isolated by distance, most likely as a result of founder effects and a dearth of outcrossing events.

Here, we review fossil ground squirrels (Sciuridae) from the region as a contribution to the broader Meade Basin Rodent Project. We recognize 14 species in seven genera: two species of giant ground squirrels (Paenemarmota Hibbard and Schultz, 1948) from the early Pliocene, and at least 12 species in six extant genera (Ammospermophilus Merriam, 1892; Otospermophilus Brandt, 1844; Ictidomys Allen, 1877; Poliocitellus Howell, 1938; Urocitellus Obolenskij, 1927; Cynomys Rafinesque, 1817) from the Pliocene - Pleistocene sequence, including the first regional records of Ammospermophilus. Based on dental morphology and the ecology of modern congeners, we interpret faunal change through the sequence as primarily reflecting a shift from a Pliocene assemblage of ""southwestern"" taxa with granivorous/omnivorous diets (relatively low-crowned, transversely narrow cheek teeth) in warm and at least occasionally dry shrub or shrub-steppe habitats (Ammospermophilus, Otospermophilus, Ictidomys meadensis [Hibbard, 1941a]), to a Pleistocene temperate assemblage of grazing taxa that either exhibited relatively high-crowned, transversely wider cheek teeth (Urocitellus, Cynomys, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus [Mitchill, 1821]) or were otherwise dependent on grassland habitats (Poliocitellus). The early Pleistocene Borchers assemblage was transitional in this regard, heralding a ""revolution"" observed as well with other clades in the Meade Basin rodent community. This interpretation is broadly congruent with evidence of Pliocene climatic change and the staged development of regional grasslands, with the modern proportion of C3/C4 plants established in the Meade Basin during the early Pleistocene. © 2017 The Paleontological Society.","Goodwin, H.T.; Martin, R.A.","","91",2017,"","","","","","","","","",""

We explore a 600 kyr marine record from ODP Site 1018, located due west of Santa Cruz, California, to identify coastal wet and dry periods and to associate them with oceanographic processes. Wet periods in central California, identified by increased tree pollen relative to pollen from grasslands and scrublands, are found on every major deglaciation in the last 600 kyr. Sea surface temperature (SST) data were collected for the last two deglaciations. Wet periods are associated with a rapid rise in SST off central California. SST gradients along the California margin and changes in biogenic deposition show that wet periods in central California are associated with a weakening of the California Current and weakened coastal upwelling. High carbonate production suggests that there was significant curl-of-wind stress upwelling offshore. We propose that wet periods in central California are associated with a meteorological connection to the tropical Pacific and weakened southward flow in the California Current that shunted temperate Pacific water northward into the Alaska gyre. We do not observe evidence for a south-shifted westerly storm track at the last glacial maximum but find that wet periods are diachronous along the California margin.

Eight hundred and fifty animals, collected from 32 populations in 20 states, were processed to obtain electrophoretic evidence on 20 blood and liver proteins. Molecular data confirm the reproductive isolation of the two species. They had different albumins, transferrins, and hemoglobins; frogs with hybrid protein patterns were not found in regions where the two species are sympatric. Within A. crepitans eight proteins were invariant across the species range; twelve exhibited one or more variant phenotypes. The genetic integrity of the species was illustrated by the uniformity of the albumin, plasma esterases, liver LDH, GOT, GDH, MDH-NADP, NADP-reductase, and hemoglobin polypeptide 4. Its polytypic nature, with geographic divergence into Plains, Delta, and Appalachian groups, was suggested by the presence of specific hemoglobin, transferrin, and liver esterase variants in animals of certain regions. Within-population polymorphism was exhibited by the transferrins, MDH-NAD, and three complexes of liver esterases; heterozygosity was greater in central than in peripheral populations. Biochemical evidence supports the hypothesis that the two species diverged during a Pleistocene disjunction of proto-Acris populations in Florida and Mexican refuges.

Plant invasions threaten the existence of endangered species and the integrity of ecosystems, and their ravages cost national economies tens of billions of dollars every year. Strategies for managing the threats posed by plant invasions involve three main tactics: prevention, eradication, and control. The effectiveness of prevention, involving enactment of legislation to prohibit the entry and spread of noxious alien plants, has been questioned. Eradication of all but the smallest, most localized weed infestations generally is not regarded as economically feasible. Conventional weed control techniques, such as mechanical and chemical controls, because they are expensive, energy and labor intensive, and require repeated application, are impractical for managing widespread plant invasions in ecologically fragile conservation areas or low-value habitat, such as rangelands and many aquatic systems. In addition, mechanical means of control disturb the soil and may cause erosion; chemical herbicides have spurred the evolution of resistance in scores of weed species and, further, may pose risks to wildlife and human health. Because of drawbacks associated with conventional weed control methods, classical biological control, the introduction of selective exotic natural enemies to control exotic pests, increasingly is being considered and implemented as a safe, cost-effective alternative to address the invasive plant problem. Worldwide, biological weed control programs have had an overall success rate of 33 percent; success rates have been considerably higher for programs in individual countries. Benefits are several-fold. Biological control is permanent, energy-efficient, nonpolluting, and inexpensive relative to other methods. Economic returns on investment in biological weed control have been spectacular in some cases, and range from an estimated benefit/cost ratio of 2.3 to 4000 or more. Although the risks involved in biological control in general are considered unacceptable by some, biological weed control in particular has had an enviable safety record. Since establishment of the stringent standards and regulatory apparatus currently in place in the United States and elsewhere, there have been no reported cases of biological weed control causing significant harm to nontarget populations or to the environment at large.

Intermittent observations from 1990 to 1998 of average volumetric soil moisture under shrub and grass cover showed that significant recharge beyond 0.30 m principally occurs only in the wintertime when the vegetation is senescent and does not use the infiltrating water. Using the physically based, variably saturated flow model HYDRUS, wintertime observations were modeled to determine the recharge of soil moisture at different depth intervals in the vadose zone. Two approaches were carried out to estimate the soil model parameters. The first was to use basic soils data from detailed profile descriptions in conjunction with pedotransfer functions. The second parameter estimation strategy was to use an automatic parameter search algorithm to find the optimal soil parameters that minimize the error between the model-computed volumetric water content and observations. Automatic calibration of the model was performed using the shuffled complex evolution algorithm (SCE-UA), and it proved possible to satisfactorily describe the vadose zone observations using a simplified description of the soil profile with optimal model parameters. Simulations with the optimized model indicate that significant recharge of vadose zone does occur well beyond 0.30 m in winter but that such recharge is highly variable from year to year and appears correlated with El Nino episodes. This water could serve as a source of plant water for deeper-rooted plants that are active during the subsequent spring season, thereby exploiting a niche that the more abundant, shallower-rooted plants that are active during the summer rainy season do not. However, the year-to-year variability of the winter precipitation and consequent deep soil moisture recharge indicates that the deeper-rooted vegetation in this region must retain the ability to obtain moisture from the near surface in order to meet its water demands if necessary.","Keefer, T.O.; Scott, R.L.; Shuttleworth, W.J.; Warrick, A.W.","","36",2000,"","","","","","","","","",""

One of these, Aspidoscelis arizonae (=A. inornata arizonae, Arizona Striped Whiptail), is extant at only a few grassland areas in southeastern Arizona, but nonetheless played an important evolutionary role in the hybrid origins of seven obligatory parthenogenetic species. Although recognized as a distinct species by many, A. arizonae lacks a valid species description and only anecdotal data argue for its recognition. We were unable to separate it from geographically proximate A. inornata in southwestern New Mexico, using diagnostic morphological features (i.e., number of stripes, dark field coloration, sky blue ventral suffusion) previously used to delineate aspidoscelids. Furthermore, we evaluated additional diagnostic characters (i.e., body size plus ten meristic characters) in samples of A. arizonae and A. i. llanuras from three adjacent counties, and found no significant size or meristic differences (P > 0.05). A canonical variate analysis of A. arizonae (n = 30), A. pai (40), A. inornata spp. (18), and A. i. llanuras (32) across seven meristic characters revealed A. arizonae as indistinguishable from A. i. llanuras (i.e., 30% misclassifications). Apart from formal nomenclature, there are only two morphological groups among the foregoing samples, A. pai and a pooling of the other three. Data from all analyses in this study suggest that either A. arizonae is a cryptic species or a peripheral isolate unworthy of species status.

A predator-prey interaction has been described firstly by Lotka and Volterra in two independent works, naming Lotka-Volterra prey-predator system, one of the fundamental population models in theoretical biology. After them, prey-predator interaction has been studied systematically in past decades. Many works on prey-predator interaction have mainly focused on the negative effect produced by predation, but no attention on the positive effect produced by predation. A set of theoretical models of co-evolution and genetic feedback mechanism suggested by laboratory experiments have shown that predation can produce the positive effect for prey. Dawkons & Krebs's description of predator-prey coevolution as an arms race also helped to revive interest in the field. Considering the positive effect for prey during the predation, this paper introduces the positive effect for prey into the classical predator-prey model and a new predator-prey system is constructed. By dynamics analysis of the system, the condition for the existence of the positive equilibrium is given. The stability of the equilibriums are also discussed, and the positive equilibrium is either stable or unstable and either a node or a focus depending on the parameter conditions. Especially we show our model has an unstable limit cycle by using the Hopf bifurcation theorem. By investigating the influence of positive effect for prey on the dynamics of the coexistence equilibrium in the first quadrant, the result show, (1) the suitable positive effect for prey in the classical predator-prey model can strengthen the stability of the system, (2) there is an unstable limit cycle in the system when increasing the positive effect reaching a certain level, and (2) the stability of the system will be changed, and both the predator and prey go towards the infinite as we continue to increase the positive effect. The computer simulation of the system supports our main results and illustrates them intuitively. Through computer, the phase portraits of all kinds of equilibriums are drawn, such as a saddle, a stable node, a stable focus, an unstable focus and an unstable limit cycle. The predictions of the model are emphasized by the results of simulation. Combining the phase portraits with the consequence predicted by simulation, the model we established can be easily to understand. These predictions of the model have the vital significance in conservation biology. From the odocoielus nemionus case which lived in Arizona Kaibab grassland of United States, we conclude that the increase in the defensive ability of prey is to increase the positive effect for prey in our system. First, the increase of positive effect has strengthen the stability of the system, while more increase in the defensive ability of prey would lead to the change of the system stability, finally it made both the predator and prey go towards the infinite and our system collapsed. It is why the number of odocoielus nemionus reduced with the reduction of their natural enemies. The case is consistent with the prediction of our model, and our model give a more reasonably explanation for the odocoielus nemionus case. On the other hand, the case has shown that our model is more realistic and reasonable.","Qi, J.; Su, Z.","","31",2011,"Limit cycle; Positive factor of regulation; Predator-prey positive effect; Prey-predator system","","","","","","","","",""

The Columbia Plateau of eastern Washington contains evidence for flooding in pre-Bull Lake, Bull Lake, and early Pinedale time. Stratigraphic relationships between flood deposits and loess, relict soils on the flood gravel, and radiocarbon dates provide the means for the relative dating of these events. The early Pinedale flood was the most extensive and left considerable high-water mark evidence in the form of (1) eroded channel margins, (2) highest flood gravel, (3) minor divide crossings, and (4) ice-rafted erratics. The water-surface gradients and channel geometry provide input data for the slope-area and contracted-opening hydraulic calculation procedures. Maximum discharges through scabland channels ranged from 752 × 106 cubic feet per second in the Rathdrum Prairie to 17.5 × 106 cubic feet per second in Rocky Coulee. At these discharges, the ponding of flood water by the Wallula Gap constriction required about a day. The flood's duration was amazingly short. Even with gradually waning flows, the early Pinedale flood probably lasted only a week or two. The Greenacres reach, near Spokane, provides the closest approximation to an alluvial reach required for the Einstein bedload calculation. The predicted unit rate of sediment transport, 3,300 lbs/sec/ft-width, is probably too high. This may arise because the laboratory flume studies, on which the Einstein procedure is based, cannot be adequately extrapolated to the huge depth-to-grain-size ratios which characterized the scabland channel geometries. Flood sediments occur as channel deposits and slack-water deposits. The channel deposits include three main types: 1. Pendant bars-streamlined mounds of relatively well sorted fore-set-bedded flood gravel; often associated with giant current ripples. 2. Eddy bars-mounds of poorly sorted flood debris deposited by eddies which formed in alcoves and tributary mouths. 3. Expansion bars-fore-set-bedded gravels deposited by the decelerating flows just downstream from a constriction; often showing armoring and scour features. The slack-water deposits occur as a sequence of silts and sands in valleys tributary to the main scabland channels. Slack-water deposits in the Tucannon River Valley show primary sedimentary structures which suggest deposition by turbidity flows initiated by transient surges up the tributary valley. Sixty trains of giant current ripples are recognized in the study area. Mean ripple chords vary from 60 to 425 feet. Mean ripple heights vary from 1.5 to 22 feet. Ripple dimensions correlate to depth, depth-slope product, maximum size of armor, mean flow velocity, and stream power. Correlation coefficients generally exceed 0.7. Correlation coefficients greater than 0.9 occur for the regressions of ripple chord versus depth-slope product and ripple chord versus stream power. These empirical relationships only allow the prediction of hydraulic parameters for the narrow range of flow conditions which characterized the flood reaches containing the giant current ripples.","","","144",1973,"","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying and compensating for errors in the NEE time series can be automated using a signal processing filter like the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The EnKF compares each measurement in the time series to a model prediction and updates the NEE estimate by weighting the measurement and model prediction relative to a specified measurement error estimate and an estimate of the model-prediction error that is continuously updated based on model predictions of earlier measurements in the time series. Because of the covariance among model variables, the EnKF can also update estimates of variables for which there is no direct measurement. The resulting estimates evolve through time, enabling the EnKF to be used to estimate dynamic variables like changes in leaf phenology. The evolving estimates can also serve as a means to test the embedded model and reconcile persistent deviations between observations and model predictions. We embedded a simple arctic NEE model into the EnKF and filtered data from an eddy covariance tower located in tussock tundra on the northern foothills of the Brooks Range in northern Alaska, USA. The model predicts NEE based only on leaf area, irradiance, and temperature and has been well corroborated for all the major vegetation types in the Low Arctic using chamber-based data. This is the first application of the model to eddy covariance data. We modified the EnKF by adding an adaptive noise estimator that provides a feedback between persistent model data deviations and the noise added to the ensemble of Monte Carlo simulations in the EnKF. We also ran the EnKF with both a specified leaf-area trajectory and with the EnKF sequentially recalibrating leaf-area estimates to compensate for persistent model-data deviations. When used together, adaptive noise estimation and sequential recalibration substantially improved filter performance, but it did not improve performance when used individually. The EnKF estimates of leaf area followed the expected springtime canopy phenology. However, there were also diel fluctuations in the leaf-area estimates; these are a clear indication of a model deficiency possibly related to vapor pressure effects on canopy conductance. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Griffin, K.L.; Hobbie, J.E.; Kling, G.W.; Kwiatkowski, B.L.; Potosnak, M.J.; Rastetter, E.B.; Shaver, G.R.; Stieglitz, M.; Stoy, P.C.; Tomasky, G.; Williams, M.","","20",2010,"Alaska; Data assimilation; Ecosystem carbon balance; Ecosystem models; Eddy covariance; Kalman filter; Net ecosystem carbon exchange; USA","","","","","","","","",""

Sediments beneath 12 lakes were examined in 76 hollow-stem auger cores and in excavations. Stacked depositional cycles recognized in lake sediments record repeated phases of (1) initial highstand, (2) ephemeral lake, and (3) lake shrinkage and prolonged exposure. Sedimentary and soil structures show that during all phases the lakes were ephemeral, but that the duration and frequency of flooding varied, which caused variation in the relative amounts of accumulation, deflation, and soil formation. The highstand phase is documented by wave-cut benches and lake sediments that extend beyond present lake margins. Mud transported as suspended load was deposited from ponded water. Desiccation resulted in mudcracks and allowed deposition of eolian sand, but exposure episodes were relatively short or infrequent, and vertic soil formation, oxidation of organic material, and deflation of sand were minimal. Decreased frequency and duration of flooding resulting in increased pedogenic modification under conditions similar to those under which modern playa lake sediments accumulate. Eolian silt deposited on dry lake beds and clays deposited in flooded lakes were mixed by vertic soil processes during repeated wetting and drying. Organic material was partly oxidized and partly translocated down roots and cracks, and interbedded upland facies were gleyed. Episodes of lake shrinkage and more frequent exposure are recorded by reddening and formation of calcic horizons within lake muds. Red-brown eolian loam prograded across lake sediments, and calcic soils developed on it.

We examined the interacting effects of shading and mechanical stress (MS) on growth, reproduction, and mechanical stability. We subjected 10 grassland genotypes and 10 forest genotypes of Impatiens capensis to two levels of spectral shading and two levels of MS. Shade induced the production of taller, thinner internodes, but this response was inhibited by MS. This interactive effect was stronger in the grassland genotypes than in the forest genotypes, indicating that shade avoidance can be suppressed by MS and that the degree of this suppression differs between habitats. Among genotypes, greater plasticity in shade-induced internode elongation resulted in a larger reduction in the ability of plants to carry their own weight. This suggests that the occurrence of mechanical constraints may strongly contribute to the selection against shade-induced elongation responses in forest understory genotypes. Our results show that combined responses to different environmental cues can result in a fine-tuning of phenotypic expression by plants by maintaining the potential to strongly respond to single environmental cues but also by preventing potential future costs resulting from poor adaptation to other stresses. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

This decoupling of scales may be largely due to sampling processes (the increasing constraint imposed by sampling fewer individuals at fine scales), as distinct from ecological processes, such as environmental heterogeneity, that operate across scales. Removal of the sampling constraint from fine-scale richness estimates should yield species-area curves that behave like those of the regions in which they are embedded, but an effective method for this removal has not been available. We suggest an approach that incorporates the manner in which small areas accumulate species over time as a way to remove the signature of sampling processes from fine-scale species-area curves.

Enhancing wildlife habitat has become an explicit objective of existing agricultural policy. Thus, there is renewed focus on field borders and the use of shelterbelt agroforestry systems to achieve conservation goals in the Midwest. Two Representative Farms - a 283-ha dryland and 510-ha irrigated farm were created in Saunders County, Nebraska. The Habitat Analysis and Modeling System (HAMS) was used to describe the composition and spatial pattern of the existing farms and surrounding landscape, as well as for the landscapes surrounding selected Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. Simulated land use changes resulting from the implementation of two shelterbelt scenarios, Agricultural and Wildlife, were incorporated on each Representative Farm and surrounding landscape. Landscape variables which influence breeding bird species richness and community composition as determined from BBS routes were measured on simulated farm landscapes. A more heterogeneous landscape results from implementing either scenario. The percent total woods was a significant determinant of bird species richness on the BBS routes and was important in influencing bird communities at the farm- and landscape-level. Other landscape metrics which influenced the bird community composition on BBS routes were woody edge percentages and edge density values. Policies promoting shelterbelts create edge habitats which ultimately favor birds within the Forest-edge/generalist guild while bird species in need of conservation such as grassland-field species would potentially be negatively affected.","Farrand, D.T.; Kurtz, W.B.; Pierce II, R.A.","","53",2001,"Conservation; Geographic information systems; Policy; Wildlife; Windbreaks","","","","","","","","",""

We established plots within three canopy types (open, old-growth and dense young pine) with different grass species compositions in a Pinus ponderosa forest in northern Arizona and collected vegetation data and surface (0-2 cm) and subsurface (2-7 cm) mineral soil samples. Surface soil phytolith assemblages strongly reflected vegetation at the site scale (within several km2). Local vegetation patterns (&lt; 50 m2) associated with overstory canopy types were weakly detected. Significantly fewer C4 grass and ponderosa pine phytoliths were found in subsurface compared to surface soils. Surface 813C values showed no difference among canopy types. Subsurface 813C values were significantly (+ 0.83 %) more enriched in 13C than surface values. Phytolith assemblages and 813C of SOM reflect long-term accumulation of organic matter in soils and may not mirror contemporary vegetation for many reasons, including spatial shifts in species distribution and productivity. Considering all our phytolith and 813C evidence, we suggest that C4 grasses were more widely distributed but less abundant, grasses were more spatially continuous, total grass productivity was greater, and species in the genus Kneleria and Bromus were more common in the past.","Hart, S.C.; Kerns, B.K.; Moore, M.M.","","8",2001,"C3; C4; Forest understory; Grasslands; Non-metric multidimensional scaling; Northern Arizona; Opal; Phytolith assemblages; Pinus ponderosa; δC13C","","","","","","","","",""

We detected low RAPD variation in five populations of A. skinneriana in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Missouri: only 1 locus out of 60 was polymorphic, with at individuals from one Wisconsin population lacking the allele at this locus. RAPD data suggest that A. skinneriana has a narrow genetic base, perhaps a cause or consequence of habitat specificity. Floral data partially corroborated RAPD data; the same Wisconsin population shown to be genetically unique also stood out in terms of its lack of corolla spotting and very small corolla size. However, populations near Lake Michigan also had unique floral characteristics that the RAPD analysis did not detect. If corolla characteristics are indicative of genetic distinctiveness, then there are at least three conservation units for this plant in Wisconsin and northeastern Illinois. Final plant height and fruit set varied considerably between populations. Seed germinability was variable within and between populations, but was generally high after a period of cold, moist stratification.

These soils formed in similar parent material but display a wide range of upper horizon morphology, organic carbon content, and chemistry, allowing assessment of the method's performance over a wide range of aggregate stability and its utility in identifying factors influencing aggregate behavior. Equations representing fine material release through breakdown of two aggregate populations as first-order processes were fit to experimental data. The best-fit parameters for these equations, and an additional index of persistent water-stable aggregate content, indicated distinct differences in aggregate behavior among the major horizons of Mollisols and Alfisols. Linear models were developed to explore the relationships between these parameters and soil physicochemical characteristics for the dataset as a whole and for subsets corresponding to four zones with different vegetation history, soil orders, and major soil horizons. The relationships identified were relatively weak (R 2 = 0.30 to 0.70). The best predictors for the parameters representing early disintegration of less stable aggregates were cation exchange capacity (CEC) and effective CEC (ECEC) for the whole dataset, although organic carbon and nitrogen contents also emerged as predictors for forest and Alfisol subsets. The best predictors for the index of persistent water-stable aggregate content were organic carbon content, base saturation, or exchangeable Ca/Mg ratio, depending on the particular subset and fine material size fraction used in the analysis. The relatively weak explanatory power of organic carbon content as a predictor of aggregate behavior in these experiments was somewhat surprising, given prior work on aggregate stability. Both CEC and ECEC may serve as proxies for the various combinations of organic matter and clay content that influence aggregate stability in these samples, explaining their importance as predictors. It is likely that other factors not examined in this research contributed to aggregate stability, including carbonate content, clay mineralogy, and differing frequency and types of pedoturbation under grassland and forest. The results of this study are relevant to reconstructing the development of texture-contrast profiles as forest invaded grassland over the past 4000 in the study area, as documented by paleoecological research. In particular, loss of organic matter below a thin A horizon may have facilitated initial development of an E horizon in which weak aggregation favored clay eluviation; loss of clay would then have weakened aggregate stability still further.

Extant seed banks exhibit unique characteristics with regard to the distribution of seed size and seed density. Seeds were recovered from the Upper Pennsylvanian Wise Formation in southwest Virginia. Structurally preserved seeds were also examined from coal balls of the Pennsylvanian Pottsville and Allegheny Groups, Ohio. The size distribution of the seeds from the Wise Formation is similar to that of structurally preserved seeds of the Upper Pennsylvanian Pottsville and Allegheny Group coal balls. In contrast, the seed size distributions in extant wetland, grassland, woodland and forest habitats are significantly narrower than that of seeds from the Pennsylvanian seed banks. Larger seeds are less dependent on light for germination, and aid in seedling establishment more than smaller seeds, especially in dense stable forests where disturbance events are rare. Large seed size may contribute to increased seed longevity, which reduces the effect of environmental variability on seed germination and development. The significantly larger size of the Palaeozoic seeds may have imparted an advantage for seedling establishment in the dense Palaeozoic forests. The preponderance of large seeds may be a result of the absence of large seed predators (e.g. herbivorous tetrapods), and may have been an evolutionary strategy to minimize damage to the embryo from a predator population dominated by small invertebrates with chewing or sucking mouthparts. The estimated seed density of 192 seeds/m2 in the Palaeozoic seed bank falls within the range of modern seed banks, but at the lower end of modern seed bank densities in a variety of habitats. © 2017 Petra S.

We found that the prehistoric grass-dominated grassland, likely maintained by frequent anthropogenic fire, extended to the landscape scale, well beyond the confines of Quiroste Valley. In a novel attempt to use the proportion of burned phytoliths in the soil to quantitatively estimate prehistoric fire frequency at nearby McCabe Canyon in Pinnacles National Park, we tested three approaches described in the phytolith literature to identify individual burned soil phytoliths and found each approach had serious problems. The first approach, identifying visually darkened phytoliths, was accurate when performed on freshly burned leaf material, but highly problematic when applied to weathered phytoliths extracted from a typical grassland soil. The second approach, using changes in the refractive index caused by heating of phytoliths, was not effective within the temperature range typical of grassland fires, and was prone to rehydration effects in the soil environment. The third approach, using Raman spectroscopy to identify phytoliths with spectral changes caused by heating of carbon occluded in phytoliths, was not able to distinguish heated, non-darkened phytoliths, but was able to distinguish visually darkened phytoliths that had been subjected to an open flame. Each approach was rejected as inadequate; we were unable to use phytoliths to quantitatively estimate prehistoric fire frequency.

We compared the volume, grain size distribution, organic content and foraminiferal assemblages of washover deposits at three sites from Galveston and San Luis Islands, Texas that were up to 50. km west of Ike's landfall. Storm surge heights varied between 3.7 and 2.7. m with inland inundation extents of 330 to 113 m. At each of the study sites, Hurricane Ike eroded the shoreline and re-deposited a landward-thinning sand sheet between 0.02 and 0.28. m thick over short-grass prairie/salt-marsh soil. Shoreline erosion estimates suggest that only between 10 and 30% of eroded beach sediment is deposited on land as washover (net gain to barrier elevation), while the remainder is re-deposited subtidally or offshore, a potential net loss to the coastal sediment budget. The washover sediment was readily identifiable by abrupt changes in grain size, organic content, and buried in situ grasses.

Restoring these disturbances can be controversial, particularly when valued resources are thought to be disturbance-sensitive. We tested the effects of fire and grazing on butterfly species richness and population density in an economically productive grassland landscape of the central U. S. Three management treatments were applied: (1) patch-burngraze-rotational burning of three spatially distinct patches within a pasture, and moderately-stocked cattle grazing (N = 5); (2) graze-and-burn-burning entire pasture every 3 years, and moderately-stocked cattle grazing (N = 4); and (3) burn-only-burning entire pasture every 3 years, but no cattle grazing (N = 4). Butterfly abundance was sampled using line transect distance sampling in 2008 and 2009, with six 100-m transects per pasture. Butterfly species richness did not respond to management treatment, but was positively associated with pre-treatment proportion of native plant cover. Population density of two prairie specialists (Cercyonis pegala and Speyeria idalia) and one habitat generalist (Danaus plexippus) was highest in the burn-only treatment, whereas density of one habitat generalist (Cupido comyntas) was highest in the patch-burn graze treatment. Treatment application affected habitat structural characteristics including vegetation height and cover of bare ground. Historic land uses have reduced native plant cover and permitted exotic plant invasion; for some butterfly species, these legacies had a greater influence than management treatments on butterfly density.

Relationships between pastoralism and wildlife conservation in three different contexts of land tenure, environmental legacy, and geography are examined. Results: On the federal rangelands of the Intermountain West, based on limited scientific information, wildlife policy has been interpreted to require separation of native bighorn sheep from livestock to prevent disease transmission. Ignored are the possible long term and broad scale impacts of removing grazing on the ecosystem and the ‘social disturbance’ to local communities. In southwestern deserts, the implementation of wildlife policy exemplifies the contradictions between conservation of individuals versus populations, and fire suppression and grazing removal as ‘inactions’ requiring no review versus grazing and burning as ‘actions’ requiring regulation and control. In California’s Mediterranean rangeland, wildlife policy under the Endangered Species Act is at once a regulatory burden and an opportunity for ranchers. The opportunities result from an evolving recognition that cessation of grazing can harm wildlife. Conclusions: In all three cases, the environment has changed and is changing due to ecosystem engineering that alters the resources available to wildlife and plant species. Grazing offers potential benefits as a management tool, and pastoralism a means of maintaining un-fragmented landscapes. Yet, absent adequate ecological information, the assumptions of innate conflict between livestock and wildlife, and that cessation of grazing is not an action, as well as the norms of a politically popular yet ecologically unsupportable discourse of restoration, fill in the gaps. © 2012, Huntsinger et al; licensee Springer.","Huntsinger, L.; Sayre, N.F.; Wulfhorst, J.D.","","2",2012,"Ecosystem engineering; Endangered Species Act; Grazing; Land use; Public lands management; Restoration; Succession; Wildlife conservation","","","","","","","","",""

These fires have been identified as harbingers of climate change, despite our limited understanding of Arctic fire frequency and climatic controls. Much of this understanding relies upon sedimentary charcoal-based fire reconstructions, yet the controls on sedimentary charcoal abundance need to be rigorously tested in tundra ecoregions. We compile published charcoal-based tundra fire reconstructions in Alaska and compare them with historical, limnological, and spatial data to: (1) evaluate the spatial and temporal characteristics of tundra fires, (2) identify the primary controls of charcoal accumulation in lake sediments, (3) assess the accuracy of peak analysis in identifying local (<1 km) fire events, and (4) constrain charcoal source area. We find that tundra fires are spatially and/or temporally dichotomous in the historical (observational) period (1940–2015 CE), a characteristic which is mimicked by charcoal accumulation rates. We show that, despite methodological differences in published studies, analyses of charcoal peaks accurately identified local (<1 km) fire events in the historical period. Further, we find that lake properties (e.g. depth and surface area) have weak influences on charcoal accumulation in the tundra and that charcoal source areas in the Alaskan tundra are much broader than in forest and grassland ecosystems. We conclude that the unique nature of tundra fire regimes allows for the reliable use of total charcoal accumulation as a fire proxy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Russell, J.M.; Sae-Lim, J.; Vachula, R.S.","","541",2020,"Arctic; Dispersal; Fire; Paleofire; Peak analysis; Source area","","","","","","","","",""

Positioned at the K-Pg transition and below a regional transgressive surface, these sand bodies previously have been interpreted as lowstand incised valley fills or as catastrophic megawave deposits associated with the end-Cretaceous bolide impact on the Yucatan peninsula. The sedimentology and ichnology of the Moscow Landing exposure were revisited in attempt to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for Clayton sand deposition. Stratigraphic relations and character of sand bodies strongly suggest that impact-generated faulting and deformation of the underlying Maastrichtian Prairie Bluff Chalk created Clayton sand depocenters, that the bulk of Clayton sands was emplaced, possibly from the south, by runup and backwash of oscillating impactgenerated megawaves, and that transgressive ravinement followed shortly after catastrophic deposition. Several Clayton sand bodies contain in their upper parts internal bioturbated horizons characterized by Thalassinoides, for which there are two viable explanations. These horizons may record short-term colonization by allochthonous crustaceans that were transported and transplanted by waning megawave currents. Alternatively, associated sand bodies may be composites; Thalassinoides horizons may reflect colonization of sands that accumulated under normal marine conditions in remaining accommodation space atop megawave deposits in response to ensuing transgression. Careful systematic biostratigraphic sampling and analyses will be necessary to test the relative virtues of these two scenarios. © 2018, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).","Savrda, C.E.","","33",2018,"","","","","","","","","",""

Temperature has strong, predictable effects on many traits, such that many traits in ectotherms follow stereotyped thermal performance curves in response to increasing temperature. The prairie lizard—an abundant lizard throughout the centralUnited States—has thermally sensitive, blue abdominal and throat patches. Currently, the role of these patches is not well understood. In this study, we set out to investigate whether individual plasticity in patch color paralleled individual plasticity in sprint speed (do they covary), and if the plasticity in these two patches signal redundant or independent information, testing competing hypotheses suggested for the evolution of multiple signals. We found that both abdominal and throat patch hue follow classical thermal performance curves, suggesting that at the species level hue is a good predictor of sprinting ability. At the individual level, we found that color and performance were statistically repeatable, so individuals with relatively high phenotypic values maintain relatively high phenotypic values across all temperatures. Additionally, we found that abdominal and patch hue covary with sprinting speed at the individual level. Together, these results suggest that the bluest individuals are the fastest individuals across temperatures.However,we foundthat abdominal and throat patch hue donot covary with eachother at the individual level, suggesting that these signals may have independent functions.

In a genomic comparison of ecotypes of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris, occurring at Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve (Colorado), we found that selective sweeps were mainly restricted to the dune ecotype and that there was variation across the genome in whether proximity to the nondune population constrained or promoted divergence. The major regions of divergence were few and large between ecotypes, in contrast with an interspecific comparison between H. petiolaris and a sympatric congener, Helianthus annuus. In general, the large regions of divergence observed in the ecotypic comparison swamped locus-specific associations with environmental variables.

The spatial scale of environmental variation relative to the average dispersal distance of a species determines whether selection will favor plasticity, local adaptation, or an intermediate strategy. Habitats where the spatial scale of environmental variation is less than the dispersal distance of a species are fine grained and should favor the expression of adaptive plasticity, while coarse-grained habitats, where environmental variation occurs on spatial scales greater than dispersal, should favor adaptive genetic differentiation. However, there is relatively little information available characterizing the link between the spatial scale of environmental variation and patterns of selection on plasticity measured in the field. I examined patterns of spatial environmental variation within a serpentine mosaic grassland and selection on an annual plant (Erodium cicutarium) within that landscape. Results indicate that serpentine soil patches are a significantly finer-grained habitat than non-serpentine patches. Additionally, selection generally favored increased plasticity on serpentine soils and diminished plasticity on non-serpentine soils.

Ecotypes of Andropogon gerardii from phosphorus-limited and nitrogenlimited grasslands were grown with all possible ""home and away"" combinations of soils and AM fungal communities. Our results indicate that Andropogon ecotypes adapt to their local soil and indigenousAMfungal communities such that mycorrhizal exchange of the most limiting resource is maximized. Grasses grown in home soil and inoculated with home AM fungi produced more arbuscules (symbiotic exchange structures) in their roots than those grown in away combinations. Also, regardless of the host ecotype, AM fungi produced more extraradical hyphae in their home soil, and locally adapted AM fungi were, therefore, able to sequester more carbon compared with nonlocal fungi. Locally adapted mycorrhizal associations were more mutualistic in the two phosphorus-limited sites and less parasitic at the nitrogen-limited site compared with novel combinations of plants, fungi, and soils. To our knowledge, these findings provide the strongest evidence to date that resource availability generates evolved geographic structure in symbioses among plants and soil organisms.

The method used to create the PASR is different from methods used in other large-scale precipitation data products and has not previously been employed for estimating pan-arctic snowfall. The NASA Interannual-to-Seasonal Prediction Project Catchment Land Surface Model is used to reconstruct solid precipitation from observed snow depth and surface air temperatures. The method is tested at four stations in the United States and Canada where results are examined in depth. Reconstructed snowfall at Dease Lake, British Columbia, and Barrow, Alaska, is higher than gauge observations. Reconstructed snowfall at Regina, Saskatchewan, and Minot, North Dakota, is lower than gauge observations, probably because snow is transported by wind out of the Prairie region and enters the hydrometeorological cycle elsewhere. These results are similar to gauge biases estimated by a water budget approach. Reconstructed snowfall is consistently higher than snowfall from the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) but does not have a consistent relationship with snowfall derived from the WMO Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Project correction algorithms. Advantages of the PASR approach include that 1) the assimilation of snow depth observations captures blowing snow where it is deposited and 2) the modeling approach takes into account physical snowpack evolution. These advantages suggest that the PASR product could be a valuable alternative to statistical gauge corrections and that arctic ground-based solid precipitation observing networks might emphasize snow depth measurements over gauges. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.","Cherry, J.E.; Déry, S.J.; Gong, G.; Stieglitz, M.; Tremblay, L.-B.","","8",2007,"","","","","","","","","",""

Kansas, was investigated using models and measurements from the 1997 Cooperative Atmosphere Surface Exchange Study (CASES-97) field experiment. As an alternative approach for studying heterogeneity, a multiscale atmospheric and surface dataset (1. 5, and 10 km) was developed, which was used to drive three land surface models, in uncoupled ID mode, to simulate the evolution of surface heat fluxes and soil moisture for approximately a 1-month period (16 April-22 May 1997) during which the natural grassland experienced a rapid greening. Model validation using both surface and aircraft measurements showed that these modeled flux maps have reasonable skill in capturing the observed surface heterogeneity related to land-use cover and soil moisture. The results highlight the significance of rapid greening of grassland in shaping the surface heterogeneity for the area investigated. The treatment of soil hydraulic properties and canopy resistance in these land surface models appears to cause the majority of differences among their results. Several factors contributing to the discrepancy between modeled and aircraft measured heat fluxes in relation to their respective time-space integration were examined. When land surface heterogeneity is pronounced, modeled heat fluxes agree better with those measured by aircraft in terms of spatial variability along flight legs.

Total soil N decreased with increasing soil age (1.1 to 0.4 kg N m-2) while the mean δ 15N values of the soil N increased by several ‰ from the youngest to oldest sites (+3.5 to +6.2 ‰). The δ 15N values of plants varied along the gradient, reflecting changing soil N pools and differences in the form of N uptake. The decline in total N storage with time is hypothesized to be due to a shift from N to P limitation with increasing soil age. The general increase in δ 15N values with time is interpreted using a N mass balance model, and appears to reflect a shift toward an increasing proportional losses of inorganic mineral forms of N (vs. organic forms) with increasing soil age. We develop a quantitative index of this trend (mineral vs. organic forms of N loss) using mass balance considerations and parameters. The %N and δ 15N values along the California age gradient were compared to the published data for a comparably aged chronosequence in Hawaii. Most striking in this comparison is the observation that the California soil and plant δ 15N values are several ‰ greater than those on comparably aged Hawaiian sites. Multiple explanations are plausible, but assuming the sites have a similar range in δ 15N values of atmospheric inputs, the isotopic differences suggest that N may be, at least seasonally, in greater excess in the strongly seasonal, semi-arid, California grassland.

The empirical relationships among body size, species richness and number of individuals may give insight into the factors controlling species diversity and the relative abundances of species. To determine these relationships, we sampled the arthropods of grasslands and savannahs at Cedar Creek, MN using sweep nets (90 525 individuals of 1225 species) and pitfall traps (12 721 individuals of 92 species). Specimens were identified, enumerated and measured to determine body size. 2. Both overall and within abundant taxonomic orders, species richness and numbers of individuals peaked at body sizes intermediate for each group. Evolution could create unimodal diversity patterns by random diversification around an ancestral body size or from size-dependent fitness differences. Local processes such as competition or predation could also create unimodal diversity distributions. 3. The average body size of a species depended significantly on its taxonomic order, but on contemporary trophic role only within the context of taxonomic order. 4. Species richness (S(i)) within size classes was related to the number of individuals (I(i)) as S(i) = I(i)/0.5. This relationship held across a 100 000-fold range of body sizes. Within size classes, abundance distributions of size classes were all similar power functions. A general rule of resource division, together with similar minimum population sizes, is sufficient to generate the relationship between species richness and number of individuals. 5. Smaller bodied species had slightly shallower abundance distributions and may, in general, persist at lower densities than larger species. 6. Our results suggest there may be fewer undescribed small arthropod species than previously thought and that most undescribed species will be smaller than arthropods.","Haarstad, J.; Siemann, E.; Tilman, D.","","68",1999,"Abundance distributions; Allometry; Conservation; Insects; Minimum viable population sizes","","","","","","","","",""

Broad glacial valley floors feature grassland winter range for ungulates, riparian vegetation that provides food and cover for a variety of species, and alluvial channels that are requisite habitat for native fish. Rapid Neogene uplift and Quaternary climatic change have created a dynamic modern environment in which catastrophic processes exert a major influence on riverine-riparian ecosystems. Uplift and glacial erosion have generated high local relief and extensive cliffs of friable volcaniclastic bedrock. As a result, steep tributary basins produce voluminous runoff and sediment during intense precipitation and rapid snowmelt. Recent major floods on trunk streams deposited extensive overbank gravels that replaced loamy soils on flood plains and allowed conifers to colonize valley-floor meadows. Tree-ring dating identifies major floods in 1918, ca. 1873, and possibly ca. 1790. In 1996 and 1997, discharge during snowmelt runoff on Soda Butte Creek approached the 100-year flood estimated by regional techniques, with substantial local bank erosion and channel widening. Indirect estimates show that peak discharges in 1918 were approximately three times greater than in 1996, with similar duration and much greater flood plain impact. Nonetheless, 1918 peak discharge reconstructions fall well within the range of maximum recorded discharges in relation to basin area in the upper Yellowstone region. The ∼ 1873 and 1918 floods produced lasting impacts on the channel form and flood plain of Soda Butte Creek. Channels may still be locally enlarged from flood erosion, and net downcutting has occurred in some reaches, leaving the pre-1790 flood plain abandoned as a terrace. Gravelly overbank deposits raise flood-plain surfaces above levels of frequent inundation and are well drained, therefore flood-plain soils are drier. Noncohesive gravels also reduce bank stability and may have persistent effects on channel form. Overall, floods are part of a suite of catastrophic geomorphic processes that exert a very strong influence on landscape patterns and valley-floor ecosystems in northeastern Yellowstone. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Volume 1 - Overview","We defined habitat requirements (source habitats) and assessed trends in these habitats for 91 species of terrestrial vertebrates on 58 million ha (145 million acres) of public and private lands within the interior Columbia basin (hereafter referred to as the basin). We also summarized knowledge about species-road relations for each species and mapped source habitats in relation to road densities for four species of terrestrial carnivores. Our assessment was conducted as part of the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project (ICBEMP), a multiresource, multidisciplinary effort by the USDA Forest Service (FS) and the USDI Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to develop an ecosystem-based strategy for managing FS and BLM lands within the basin. Our results indicated that habitats for species, groups, and families associated with old-forest structural stages, with native grasslands, or with native shrublands have undergone strong, widespread decline. Implications of these results for managing old-forest structural stages include consideration of (1) conservation of habitats in sub-basins and watersheds where decline in old forests has been strongest; (2) silvicultural manipulations of mid-seral forests to accelerate development of late-seral stages; and (3) long-term silvicultural manipulations and long-term accommodation of fire and other disturbance regimes in all forested structural stages to hasten development and improvement in the amount, quality, and distribution of old-forest stages. Implications of our results for managing rangelands include the potential to (1) conserve native grasslands and shrublands that have not undergone large-scale reduction in composition of native plants; (2) control or eradicate exotic plants on native grasslands and shrublands where invasion potential or spread of exotics is highest; and (3) restore native plant communities by using intensive range practices where potential for restoration is highest. Our analysis also indicated that >70 percent of the 91 species are affected negatively by one or more factors associated with roads. Moreover, maps of the abundance of source habitats in relation to classes of road density suggested that road-associated factors hypothetically may reduce the potential to support persistent populations of terrestrial carnivores in many subbasins. Management implications of our summarized road effects include the potential to mitigate a diverse set of negative factors associated with roads. Comprehensive mitigation of road-associated factors would require a substantial reduction in the density of existing roads as well as effective control of road access in relation to management of livestock, timber, recreation, hunting, trapping, mineral development, and other human activities. A major assumption of our work was that validation research will be conducted by agency scientists and other researchers to corroborate our findings. As a preliminary step in the process of validation, we found high agreement between trends in source habitats and prior trends in habitat outcomes that were estimated as part of the habitat outcome analysis for terrestrial species within the basin. Results of our assessment also were assumed to lead to finer scale evaluations of habitats for some species, groups, or families as part of implementation procedures. Implementation procedures are necessary to relate our findings to local conditions; this would enable managers to effectively apply local conservation and restoration practices to support broad-scale conservation and restoration strategies that may evolve from our findings.","Eames, M.R.; Hann, W.J.; Hargis, C.D.; Holthausen, R.S.; Lee, D.C.; Murphy, W.J.; Rich, T.D.; Rowland, M.M.; Saab, V.A.; Wales, B.C.; Wisdom, M.J.","","",2000,"Cluster analysis; Conservation; Forest management; Habitat; Habitat condition; Habitat management; Habitat trend; Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project; Interior Columbia basin; Landscape analysis; Landscape ecology; Monitoring; Population viability; Rangeland management; Restoration; Sink; Sink environment; Source; Source environment; Source habitat; Source habitats; Spatial analysis; Species groups; Species of focus; Terrestrial vertebrates; Validation research; Viability; Wildlife; Wildlife-habitat relations","","","","","","","","",""

In general, the domes are nearly circular in plan with maximum land surface elevations 23-52 m asl. Geomorphic evidence of salt-induced uplift includes surface lineations, aligned gullies, excessively steep land surface topography, and shear fractures in surficial sediments. Evidence of subsidence includes sinkhole ponds a few hectares in area, broad topographic saddles over tens of hectares in size, and kilometer-scale collapse structures. On each of the Five Islands, Peoria Loess and silty colluvium bury a paleosol developed in the Late Pleistocene Prairie Complex of the Lower Mississippi Valley. The loess represents a single genetic unit of eolian origin, is typically thickest on lower side slopes, and is thin or absent on ridge crests. The silty colluvium around the perimeter of the islands is a reworked loess derived from higher elevations. Shear fractures with high-angle average dips occur in both Peoria Loess and the Prairie Complex. Conjugate shear pairs probably develop from extensional stress associated with vertical uplift of the underlying salt. Prairie Complex deposition and initial soil development in a low-relief alluvial plain of the Mississippi River predates the latest emergence of the Five Islands. Loess and colluvial stratigraphy indicate that the domes were emergent during loess deposition. Gully incision, shearing of Quaternary sediments, and the distribution of colluvium indicate continued uplift after loess deposition. Sinkholes and collapse structures are influenced by salt dissolution and corrasion, whereas broad subsidence areas and topographic saddles form over areas of structural weakness within the salt. Five Islands landscape evolution is controlled by the interaction of driving and resisting forces that operate over various time scales. Diapiric uplift is a driving force of net upwards motion, and the external and internal salt dome hydrology are driving forces of solution and corrasion. The structure and lithology of the internal salt stocks and the surrounding sediments are heterogeneous and have variable strength. Collectively, this interaction produces both uplift and subsidence features across the salt dome landscape. Resource use at the Five Islands correlate with instability of both underground facilities and the surface landscape. Uplift of the Five Islands has continued since at least the Late Pleistocene, is probably still active at present, and periods of tectonic and geomorphic instability are possible in the future. Sediments overlying salt domes record discrete periods of surface uplift and periods of episodic and incremental subsidence that is common where salt domes pierce surficial sediment. The rate, magnitude, and pattern of landscape modification by salt domes have implications for the safe utilization of mineral extraction and geostorage facilities. Geomorphic evaluation of salt dome landscapes can help to develop policies that ensure safe salt dome utilization. Salt dome resource planning should include detailed characterization of internal and external stratigraphy and structure; modeling of geomorphic, soil and rock mechanic, and hydrologic processes; routine and emergency planning at operating facilities; and closure and post-closure plans. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The fluctuating resource hypothesis (FRH) postulates that invasibility is an emergent community property, a manifestation of multiple processes that cannot be reliably predicted by individual community attributes like diversity or productivity. Yet, research has emphasized the role of these individual attributes, with the expectation that diversity should deter invasibility and productivity enhance it. In an effort to explore how these and other factors may influence invasibility, we evaluated the relationship between invasibility and species richness, productivity, resource availability, and resilience in experiments crossing disturbance with exotic seed addition in 1-m2 plots replicated over large expanses of grasslands in Montana, USA and La Pampa, Argentina. Disturbance increased invasibility as predicted by FRH, but grasslands were more invasible in Montana than La Pampa whether disturbed or not, despite Montana's higher species richness and lower productivity. Moreover, invasibility correlated positively with nitrogen availability and negatively with native plant cover. These patterns suggested that resource availability and the ability of the community to recover from disturbance (resilience) better predicted invasibility than either species richness or productivity, consistent with predictions from FRH. However, in ambient, unseeded plots in Montana, disturbance reduced native cover by &gt;50% while increasing exotic cover &gt;200%. This provenance bias could not be explained by FRH, which predicts that colonization processes act on species’ traits independent of origins. The high invasibility of Montana grasslands following disturbance was associated with a strong shift from perennial to annual species, as predicted by succession theory. However, this shift was driven primarily by exotic annuals, which were more strongly represented than perennials in local exotic vs. native species pools. We attribute this provenance bias to extrinsic biogeographic factors such as disparate evolutionary histories and/or introduction filters selecting for traits that favor exotics following disturbance. Our results suggest that (1) invasibility is an emergent property best explained by a community's efficiency in utilizing resources, as predicted by FRH but (2) understanding provenance biases in biological invasions requires moving beyond FRH to incorporate extrinsic biogeographic factors that may favor exotics in community assembly. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","Cock, M.C.; Eren, Ö.; Hierro, J.L.; Lekberg, Y.; Ortega, Y.K.; Pearson, D.E.; Villarreal, D.","","99",2018,"community assembly; diversity; fluctuating resource hypothesis; invasibility; invasion; productivity; resilience; resource availability","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we determined whether evolutionary changes in root traits occurred during re-seeding of Elymus elymoides, a native bunchgrass. We grew plants from seeds collected from survivors in two restoration sites and compared them with plants grown from the original seed, with and without competition from B.tectorum. We quantified competition, root allocation, and morphology over time. Relative to the original seed source, E.elymoides plants that established in restoration sites showed small but significant increases in root biomass fraction, and plants were smaller, both aboveground and belowground, with parallel results seen in both field sites. In contrast, E. elymoides seed sources were not significantly different in competitive response to or in competitive effect on B.tectorum. Thus, results are consistent with natural selection favoring traits that allowed plants to establish in B.tectorum invaded areas but not traits that increased competitive ability.

Reclamation of mined land, including drainage system reconstruction, is evolving through increased use of geomorphic principals and site specific environmental conditions to design and construct surface topography that is geomorphically and hydrologically stable, aesthetically pleasing, and suitable for and capable of supporting post-disturbance land uses. A case study that exemplifies the benefits of using this fluvial geomorphic design and construction approach is reclamation of a surface quarry at GCC Rio Grande, Inc.'s Tijeras Cement Plant and Limestone Mine, Tijeras, New Mexico; a semi-arid region of the United States. Surface quarrying removes burden and limestone resources that normally results in the mined area becoming significantly lower in elevation than surrounding undisturbed land. Typically, backfill materials are limited in availability at the conclusion of mining; backfilling frequently requires earthen materials to be hauled into the reclamation area. Fluvial geomorphic post-mining topography (""PMT"") designs must: 1) Incorporate mined-out quarry features; 2) Aesthetically blend reclaimed surfaces into adjacent undisturbed lands; 3) Optimize the use of in situ with imported backfill materials; 4) Establish reconstructed soil depths adequate to support growth of desired vegetation communities; 5) Produce a stable landform; and 6) Reconstruct adequate drainage features. Backfilling and grading operations used state-of-the-art GPS machine control to create the PMT that mimics adjacent natural land forms. Contour furrows were surveyed and constructed using bulldozers equipped with 3-gang rippers to provide temporary erosion control, create surface roughening, alleviate compaction and enhance stormwater harvesting. After lying ""fallow"" for 1 year, minor erosion features were mitigated and the area was broadcast seeded with a native rangeland mixture. Woody transplants were planted to enhance vegetation community development This case study compares the latest fluvial geomorphic PMT design method with conventional terrace and drain PMT methods.

Livestock overgrazing and the associated reduction of fine fuels has been a primary driver of shrub encroachment in the southwestern United States, but shrublands continue to persist despite livestock removal and grassland restoration efforts. We hypothesized that an herbivory feedback from native mammals may contribute to continued suppression of grasses after the removal of livestock. Our herbivore exclusion experiment in southeastern Arizona included five treatment levels and allowed access to native mammals based on their relative body size, separating the effects of rodents, lagomorphs, and mule deer. We included two control treatments and replicated each treatment 10 times (n = 50). We introduced uniform divisions of lawn sod (Cynodon dactylon) into each exclosure for 24-hr periods prior to (n = 2) and following (n = 2) the monsoon rains and used motion-activated cameras to document herbivore visitations. In the pre-monsoon trials, treatments that allowed lagomorph access had less sod biomass relative to other treatments (p < 0.001), averaging 44% (SD 36%) and 29% (SD 45%) remaining biomass after the 24-hr trial periods. Following the onset of monsoons, differences in remaining biomass among treatments disappeared. Desert cottontails (Sylvilagus audubonii) were detected more frequently than any of the other 11 herbivore species present at the site, accounting for 83% of detections during the pre-monsoon trials. Significantly more (p < 0.001) desert cottontails were detected during the pre-monsoon trials (2,077) compared to the post-monsoon trials (174), which coincided with biomass removal from lagomorph accessible treatments. We conclude that desert cottontails are significant consumers of herbaceous vegetation in shrub-encroached arid grasslands and they, along with other native herbivores, may act as a biotic feedback contributing to the competitive advantage and persistence of shrubs. © 2018 The Authors.

In order to understand the conditions that are conducive to plague outbreaks and potentially predict spatial and temporal variations in risk, it is important to understand the factors associated with flea abundance and distribution that may lead to plague outbreaks. We collected and identified 20,041 fleas from 6,542 individual prairie dogs of four different species over a 4-year period along a latitudinal gradient from Texas to Montana. We assessed local climate and other factors associated with flea prevalence and abundance, as well as the incidence of plague outbreaks. Oropsylla hirsuta, a prairie dog specialist flea, and Pulex simulans, a generalist flea species, were the most common fleas found on our pairs. High elevation pairs in Wyoming and Utah had distinct flea communities compared with the rest of the study pairs. The incidence of prairie dogs with Yersinia pestis detections in fleas was low (n = 64 prairie dogs with positive fleas out of 5,024 samples from 4,218 individual prairie dogs). The results of our regression models indicate that many factors are associated with the presence of fleas. In general, flea abundance (number of fleas on hosts) is higher during plague outbreaks, lower when prairie dogs are more abundant, and reaches peak levels when climate and weather variables are at intermediate levels. Changing climate conditions will likely affect aspects of both flea and host communities, including population densities and species composition, which may lead to changes in plague dynamics. Our results support the hypothesis that local conditions, including host, vector, and environmental factors, influence the likelihood of plague outbreaks, and that predicting changes to plague dynamics under climate change scenarios will have to consider both host and vector responses to local factors. © 2018 The Authors.

Based on the theory of thermodynamics and the analysis of the resultant stress-strain curves, a method of calculating the rock energy density from the characteristics of the loading and unloading curves was proposed. The energy densities of rock specimens under different loading and unloading rates were determined. The influence of loading and unloading rates on the rock energy evolution was discussed, and the evolution and distribution laws of energy accumulation and dissipation in the rock during the prepeak stage were revealed. The experimental results showed that rock energy density increases nonlinearly with an increase in the axial loading stress under different loading and unloading rates. The total absorbed energy density increases at the fastest rate, followed by the elastic energy density, and the dissipated energy density increases at the slowest rate. Elastic energy density shows a trend of ""increasing first and then decreasing,"" while the dissipation energy density shows the opposite trend.

Understanding microbial responses to warming-induced environmental changes is critical to evaluating their influences on soil biogeochemical cycles. In this study, a functional gene array (i.e., geochip 4.2) was used to analyze the functional capacities of soil microbial communities collected from a naturally degrading permafrost region in Central Alaska. Varied thaw history was reported to be the main driver of soil and plant differences across a gradient of minimally, moderately, and extensively thawed sites. Compared with the minimally thawed site, the number of detected functional gene probes across the 15–65 cm depth profile at the moderately and extensively thawed sites decreased by 25% and 5%, while the community functional gene β-diversity increased by 34% and 45%, respectively, revealing decreased functional gene richness but increased community heterogeneity along the thaw progression. Particularly, the moderately thawed site contained microbial communities with the highest abundances of many genes involved in prokaryotic C degradation, ammonification, and nitrification processes, but lower abundances of fungal C decomposition and anaerobic-related genes. Significant correlations were observed between functional gene abundance and vascular plant primary productivity, suggesting that plant growth and species composition could be co-evolving traits together with microbial community composition.

Here, we review current understanding of the factors that shape this transition, and how it may change under various drivers of local or global change. At broadest scales, the location of the transition is shaped by water availability, mediated strongly at local scales by fire regimes, herbivory pressure and spatial variation in soil properties. The frequently dynamic nature of this transition suggests that forest and savannah can exist as alternative stable states, maintained and separated by fire–grass feedbacks and tree shade–fire suppression feedback. However, this theory is still contested and the relative contributions of the main biotic and abiotic drivers and their interactions are yet not fully understood. These drivers interplay with a wide range of ecological processes and attributes at the global, continental, regional and local scales. The evolutionary history of the biotic and abiotic drivers and processes plays an important role in the current distributions of these transitions as well as in their species composition and ecosystem functioning. This ecotone can be sensitive to shifts in climate and other driving factors, but is also potentially stabilized by negative feedback processes. There is abundant evidence that these transitions are shifting under contemporary global and local changes, but the direction of shift varies according to region. However, it still remains uncertain how these transitions will respond to rapid and multi-faceted ongoing current changes, and how increasing human influence will interact with these shifts.

We characterized the levels of genetic diversity and population genetic structure using 10 neutral nuclear microsatellite loci for twelve populations (native and transplanted) representative of the three management designated ""recovery units,"" found in three distinct biogeographic regions, sampled across the species' range. The results indicate (1) low levels of genetic diversity within colonies (He = 0.109-0.357; Ho = 0.106-0.313), (2) high levels of genetic differentiation among colonies (global FST = 0.296), (3) very small genetic effective population sizes, and (4) evidence of genetic bottlenecks. The genetic data reveal additional subdivision such that colonies within recovery units do not form single genotype clusters consistent with recovery unit boundaries. Genotype cluster membership support historical gene flow among colonies in the easternmost West Desert Recovery Unit with the westernmost Pausaugunt colonies and among the eastern Pausaugunt colonies and the Awapa Recovery unit to the north. In order to maintain the long-term viability of the species, there needs to be an increased focus on maintaining suitable habitat between groups of existing populations that can act as connective corridors. The location of future translocation sites should be located in areas that will maximize connectivity, leading to maintenance of genetic variation and evolutionary potential. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Brown, N.L.; Peacock, M.M.; Ritchie, M.E.","","6",2016,"Bayesian genotype clustering analysis; Genetic diversity; Genetic structure; Threatened; Utah prairie dog","","","","","","","","",""

The extent of gene flow and genetic differentiation across interfertile ecotypes that span major habitats in the California Floristic Province is understudied, however, and is important for understanding the prospects for local adaptation to evolve or persist in the face of potential gene flow across populations in different ecological settings. We used microsatellite data to examine local differentiation in one of these lineages, the Pacific Coast polyploid complex of the plant genus Grindelia (Asteraceae). We examined 439 individuals in 10 different populations. The plants grouped broadly into a coastal and an inland set of populations. The coastal group contained plants from salt marshes and coastal bluffs, as well as a population growing in a serpentine grassland close to the coast, while the inland group contained grassland plants. No evidence for hybridization was found at the single location where adjacent populations of the two groups were sampled. In addition to differentiation along ecotypic lines, there was also a strong signal of local differentiation, with the plants grouping strongly by population. The strength of local differentiation is consistent with the extensive morphological variation observed across populations and the history of taxonomic confusion in the group. The Pacific Clade of Grindelia and other young Californian plant groups warrant additional analysis of evolutionary divergence along the steep coast-to-inland climatic gradient, which has been associated with local adaptation and ecotype formation since the classic studies of Clausen, Keck, and Hiesey. © 2014 Moore et al.","Baldwin, B.G.; Moore, A.J.; Moore, W.L.","","9",2014,"","","","","","","","","",""

R. A. Fisher in 1930 hypothesized that frequency-dependent selection would result in equal investment in sons and daughters over the long term, yielding a balanced sex ratio if the costs of raising a son and daughter are equal. Diverse hypotheses have tried to explain population and brood-by-brood deviations from this mean as well as annual variation by focusing on adult sex ratios, resources, abiotic conditions, and female and male quality. We collected data in 2002-2010 to explore population-level variation in nestling sex ratios in 2 migratory grassland songbird species: the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis). These species differ in migratory strategy (long-distance vs. short-distance), and morphological dimorphism. Fisher's hypothesis was rejected for Savannah Sparrows (n = 684 nestlings; 39% male) but not rejected for Bobolinks (n = 390 nestlings; 53.8% male). No relationship was found between nestling and adult sex ratios measured in the same year. In descriptive analyses at the brood level, male and female body size and age, and ecological conditions (temperature and precipitation) failed to predict nestling sex ratios. Although male nestlings were heavier than female nestlings and resource availability changed through the season, these factors did not influence sex ratios relative to female body size or seasonality. For Savannah Sparrows, larger broods tended to be male-biased. While we were otherwise not able to explain deviation in offspring sex ratio for Savannah Sparrows, our results suggest that the ecological and evolutionary pressures that affect sex ratios may be both species- and population-specific. © 2014 American Ornithologists' Union.","Dunbar, C.A.; Perlut, N.G.; Strong, A.M.; Travis, S.E.; Wright, D.M.","","131",2014,"Bobolink; Dolichonyx oryzivorus; Fisher's hypothesis; Passerculus sandwichensis; Savannah Sparrow; Vermont; homeostasis hypothesis; nestling sex ratio adjustment","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the rooting strategies employed by vegetation can be critical to their survival. However, land surface models currently prescribe rooting profiles as a function of only the plant functional type of interest with no consideration for the soil texture or rainfall regime of the region being modeled. Additionally, these models do not incorporate the ability of vegetation to dynamically alter their rooting strategies in response to transient changes in environmental forcings or competition from other plant species and therefore tend to underestimate the resilience of these ecosystems. To address the simplicity of the current representation of roots in land surface models, a new dynamic rooting scheme was incorporated into the framework of the distributed ecohydrological model tRIBS+VEGGIE. The new scheme optimizes the allocation of carbon to the root zone to reduce the perceived stress of the vegetation, so that root profiles evolve based upon local climate and soil conditions. The ability of the new scheme to capture the complex dynamics of natural systems was evaluated by comparisons to hourly timescale energy flux, soil moisture, and vegetation growth observations from the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona. Robust agreement was found between the model and observations, providing confidence that the improved model is able to capture the multidirectional interactions between climate, soil, and vegetation at this site. ©2013.

Recovery of thermophilic fungi from soils showed seasonal fluctuations, with greater abundance correlating with spring and summer precipitation peaks. In addition to grassland soils, we obtained and characterized isolates from grassland and riparian litter, herbivore dung and biological soil crusts. All strains belonged to either the Eurotiales or Sordariales (Chaetomiaceae). No particular substrate or microhabitat associations were detected. Molecular typing of strains revealed substantial phylogenetic diversity, eight ad hoc phylogroups across the two orders were identified and genetic diversity was present within each phylogroup. Growth tests over a range of temperatures showed substantial variation in maximum growth rates among strains and across phylogroups but consistency within phylogroups. Results demonstrated that 45-50 C represents the optimal temperature for growth of most isolates, with a dramatic decline at 60 C. Most strains grew at 60 C, albeit slowly, whereas none grew at 65 C, providing empirical confirmation that 60 C presents an evolutionary threshold for fungal growth. Our results support the hypothesis that fungal thermophily is an adaptation to transient seasonal and diurnal high temperatures, rather than simply an adaptation to specialized high-temperature environments.

For example, exotic plant and microbe mutualists can facilitate each other's spread as they co-invade novel ranges. Environmental context may influence the effect of mutualisms on invasions in heterogeneous environments, however these effects are poorly understood. We examined the mutualism between the legume, Medicago polymorpha, and the rhizobium, Ensifer medicae, which have both invaded California grasslands. Many of these invaded grasslands are composed of a patchwork of harsh serpentine and relatively benign non-serpentine soils. We grew legume genotypes collected from serpentine or non-serpentine soil in both types of soil in combination with rhizobium genotypes from serpentine or non-serpentine soils and in the absence of rhizobia. Legumes invested more strongly in the mutualism in the home soil type and trends in fitness suggested that this ecotypic divergence was adaptive. Serpentine legumes had greater allocation to symbiotic root nodules in serpentine soil than did non-serpentine legumes and non-serpentine legumes had greater allocation to nodules in non-serpentine soil than did serpentine legumes. Therefore, this invasive legume has undergone the rapid evolution of divergence for soil-specific investment in the mutualism. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the mutualism was less beneficial for legumes grown on the stressful serpentine soil than on the non-serpentine soil, possibly due to the inhibitory effects of serpentine on the benefits derived from the interaction. The soil-specific ability to allocate to a robust microbial mutualism may be a critical, and previously overlooked, adaptation for plants adapting to heterogeneous environments during invasion. © 2011 Porter et al.","Porter, S.S.; Rice, K.J.; Stanton, M.L.","","6",2011,"","","","","","","","","",""

Paleoecological records indicate the importance of such relationships in Minnesota's Big Woods (BW) region, where isolated hardwood forest populations expanded to regional dominance after AD 1250. We used LANDIS-II to model the BW forest expansion, and conducted simulation experiments that isolated the important ecological factors in this regional change. In our simulations, BW forest expanded at approximately 15 m per year to achieve regional dominance within 600 years, which is comparable to empirical records. The distribution of the BW depended on the locations of scattered pre-existing tree populations that were sheltered from previous severe fire regimes by firebreaks. During the simulated spread of the tree populations, however, the presence or absence of firebreaks did not further influence vegetation pattern. When we assumed a fire rotation of 10-13 years in grasslands/woodlands and more than 400 years in BW, the feedback between fire-resistant BW fuels and fire severity caused fire severity to decline in a time frame consistent with sedimentary data. In our simulations, seed dispersal from core initial populations caused forest expansion, changed fuel loads, and thus reduced fire severity-not the other way around as has been commonly proposed. Forest expansion was slowed by fire, but species' life history attributes, namely seed dispersal distances and maturity ages, asynchronous successional dynamics across many stands, and landscape history were at least as important in the temporal and spatial patterns of the regional response to climate change. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Berland, A.; Manson, S.M.; Shuman, B.","","14",2011,"Big Woods; LANDIS-II; Minnesota; fire; forest expansion; paleoecology; spatially explicit model","","","","","","","","",""

It is increasingly clear that landscape features have large impacts on dispersal patterns. Thus, understanding how individuals and species move through landscapes is essential for predicting impacts of landscape alterations. Information on dispersal patterns, however, is lacking for many taxa, particularly reptiles. Eastern foxsnakes (Mintoinus gloydi) are marsh and prairie specialists that avoid agricultural fields, but they have persisted across a fragmented region in southwestern Ontario and northern Ohio. Here, we combined habitat suitability modelling with population genetic analyses to infer how foxsnakes disperse through a habitat mosaic of natural and altered landscape features. Boundary regions between the eight genetic clusters, identified through assignment tests, were comprised of low suitability habitat (e.g. agricultural fields). Island populations were grouped into a single genetic cluster, and comparatively low FST values between island and mainland populations suggest open water presents less of a barrier than nonsuitable terrestrial habitat. Isolation by resistance and least-cost path analysis produced similar results with matrices of pairwise individual genetic distance significantly more correlated to matrices of resistance values derived from habitat suitability than models with an undifferentiated landscape. Spatial autocorrelation results matched better with assignment results when incorporating resistance values rather than straight-line distances.

One of the mechanisms involved in the mineralization involves small bedrock features of high permeability located in places occupied by streams and rivers in past geological eras. These geological features are termed 'paleodrainage channels'. The permeability of the overlying aquifer can be significantly smaller than that of the channel fill material. The comparatively fast migration of saline water through these channels of high permeability is associated with the transfer of minerals into the overlying freshwater aquifer. This study applies a set of boundary layer approaches to quantify the process of mineral transfer from the channels into the aquifer. The methods used in the present study provide quick estimation and evaluation of the dilution of the channel flow, as well as mineral concentration profile changes in the mineralized zone created in the overlying aquifer. More generally, the method can also be useful for the analysis and evaluation of various types of groundwater contamination in heterogeneous aquifers. The application of the method is exemplified by a complete set of calculations characterizing the possible mineralization process at a specific channel in south central Kansas. Sensitivity analyses are performed and provide information about the importance of the various parameters that affect the mineralization process. Some possible scenarios for the aquifer mineralization phenomena are described and evaluated. It is shown that the channel mineralization may create either several stream tubes of the aquifer with high mineral concentration, or many stream tubes mineralized to a lesser extent.

A marine transgressive wedge correlatable with the Williana Formation contains Foraminifera which suggest water as deep as 600 feet. A reef-type assemblage in the base of these beds indicates a climate warmer than at present in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Marine sediments correlatable with the Bentley Formation yielded fossils suggestive of depths of deposition as great as 400 feet. Another reef-type deposit is present in the lower part of these beds. Several depositional cycles of lesser magnitude are apparent in the upper part of the Pleistocene section. The last major transgression correlates with the Prairie Formation, and evidence for water as deep as 400 feet over the present tidelands is shown. Still another reef-type assemblage is seen in the lower part of this wedge. The sandy section below the Williana beds does not present a means of recognizing the base of the Pleistocene, but it may be logically assumed on the basis of the thickness of overlying cyclic deposition to be near 4200 feet.

Hmax, RGR, T10 and T90 (Julian day when plant height was 10% and 90%Hmax respectively) were derived from a logistic function for each species and were analysed in relation to LMA and SD. 3.Hmax was positively correlated with T10, T90 and flowering onset time (Julian day when the first 10% of flowers were blossoming) across species and across evolutionary-correlated divergences. Early growing and flowering species were shorter than late ones, and species reaching Hmax earlier flowered earlier than their counterparts. 4.There was a positive relationship between T90 and RGR, in which early growing species were usually at mid-to-high levels of RGR, while late-growing ones had widely varied RGR. A similar relationship was found between flowering onset time and RGR. RGR was significantly negatively correlated with SD and LMA but positively with hollow ratio, as indicated by correlation analysis and phylogenetically independent comparative analysis. 5.Based on the above results, we propose that herbaceous species have two major dimensions of height growth strategies (early vs. late and fast vs. slow growth), collectively resulting in three extreme cases (early and fast, late and slow, and late and fast). Different height growth trajectories resulting from these strategies may reduce asymmetric competition among co-existing species in dense grasslands. 6.Synthesis.

Through a widespread major unconformity this succession has been subdivided into the Butana Bridge Synthem (BBS) and Khashm El Girba Synthem (KGS). In the latter minor unconformities mark the boundaries between KGS1, KGS2 and KGS3 subsynthems. The BBS is 10 m thick, starts with braided stream gravel and terminates with high-sinuosity river sand. An intermediate silty interval with a well-developed calcrete marks a period of reduced clastic input and morphological stability. The BBS yielded vertebrate remains and many Acheulean artefacts and was deposited from the late Early Pleistocene to the early Middle Pleistocene. After a gap of some hundred thousand years the sedimentary record continues with 40 m thick KGS fluvial deposits. They are quite diversified and include sands from meandering rivers (KGS1) abruptly interrupted by braided river deposits that evolve to sinuous river sands (KGS2), and, finally, from braided river pebbly sands to sheet flows (KGS3). The KGS yielded abundant vertebrate remains and late Acheulean to Middle Stone Age artefacts. Mollusc patch reefs with stromatolitic coatings at the base of the KGS2 and KGS3 gave U/Th ages of 126.1 kyr+/-1.0 kyr and 92.2 kyr+/-0.7 kyr, respectively. These datings, together with fossil assemblages, and artefacts indicate a late Middle Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene age for the KGS. The entire succession makes a northward (Goz Regeb area) transition into fluvio-lacustrine deposits related to the ""Atbara palaeolake"". Through palaeohydrological analyses bankfull discharges have been estimated in some KGS1 and KGS2 fluvial channels. They resulted into one order of magnitude less than the present-day Atbara river. The variations in fluvial style and discharge were connected with climatic changes, river network modifications induced by tectonics, and palaeolake Atbara level variations. Due to defined time constrains, the climate changes recorded in the KGS are matched with the Pleistocene Marine Isotope Stages (MIS). The KGS1 meandering rivers can be referred to the MIS 7 wet period, and the episodes of increasing rainfall in KGS2 and KGS3 to the Eemian MIS 5.5 and MIS 5.3 followed by arid conditions (MIS 4?).

Novel ecosystems are good model systems for understanding how diversity maintenance mechanisms might differ between species with a history of interaction (natives) and species without a history (exotics) in cases where exotics originated from several continents. We tested for lower species diversity and richness in exotic grasslands and found a negative correlation between species diversity measures and proportion of exotic species across 15 grasslands in an observational study in Texas. We then planted 9-species mixtures of all native or all exotics under ambient or elevated summer precipitation to compare dynamics of diversity and to test if exotic species respond more strongly to altered resource availability. Species diversity was lower in communities of exotic than native species by the second year. Reduced diversity in exotic communities resulted from lower complementarity and higher temporal niche overlap among species and occurred in both ambient and irrigated plots. In general, summer irrigation had additive positive effects and did not interact with native-exotic status. Exotic species and communities had much earlier green-up during spring than natives, and altered inter-correlations among phenology variables. There were no differences in flowering dates. Taken together, our results suggest that rapid and synchronous growth may increase niche overlap among exotic species and reduce local diversity in exotic-dominated grassland communities. Earlier green-up by exotics may complicate attempts to ascertain relationships between phenology and climate. An increase in exotic species may cause earlier green-up regardless of any climate change effects and our results suggest that phenology networks should take a species-based rather than an ecosystem approach to evaluate green-up if the abundance of exotics increases within the time-frame in question.

Fire, like herbivory, is a top-down driver that converts organic materials into inorganic products, alters community structure, and acts as an evolutionary agent. Though grazing and fire may have some comparable effects in grasslands, they do not have similar impacts on species composition and community structure. However, the concept of fire as a global herbivore implies that fire and herbivory may have similar effects on plant functional traits. Using 22 years of data from a mesic, native tallgrass prairie with a long evolutionary history of fire and grazing, we tested if trait composition between grazed and burned grassland communities would converge, and if the degree of convergence depended on fire frequency. Additionally, we tested if eliminating fire from frequently burned grasslands would result in a state similar to unburned grasslands, and if adding fire into a previously unburned grassland would cause composition to become more similar to that of frequently burned grasslands. We found that grazing and burning once every four years showed the most convergence in traits, suggesting that these communities operate under similar deterministic assembly rules and that fire and herbivory are similar disturbances to grasslands at the trait-group level of organization. Three years after reversal of the fire treatment we found that fire reversal had different effects depending on treatment. The formerly unburned community that was then burned annually became more similar to the annually burned community in trait composition suggesting that function may be rapidly restored if fire is reintroduced. Conversely, after fire was removed from the annually burned community trait composition developed along a unique trajectory indicating hysteresis, or a time lag for structure and function to return following a change in this disturbance regime. We conclude that functional traits and species-based metrics should be considered when determining and evaluating goals for fire management in mesic grassland ecosystems. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Aicher, R.J.; Collins, S.L.; Koch, G.R.; Marquardt, E.S.; Mirotchnick, N.; Spasojevic, M.J.; Troxler, T.G.","","91",2010,"Disturbance; Fire; Grassland; Grazing; Plant functional traits; Prairie","","","","","","","","",""

Shrub encroachment (also known as shrub invasion)is a typical pattern of patchy shrub distribution. This phenomenon represents one of the major environmental problems faced by the world’s grassland ecosystems, and widely occurs in Africa, the USA, Australia, Asia, Europe. Shrub encroachment is exacerbated by overgrazing, prairie fires, climate change, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and biotic and abiotic environmental factors. Precipitation is considered to be an influential factor of patchy shrub distribution in arid and semiarid regions, which may regulate shrub coverage and the patch size. Theoretically, a steady shrub ecosystem would have a balance between water supply and demand, while certain levels of precipitation should correspond with optimal shrub coverage, i.e., the optimal ratio of shrub patch size to the total area in the steady patchy shrub ecosystem. The maximum entropy production principle (MEP)to living systems may be used to quantitatively explain optimization in the non-equilibrium process, such as the evolution of biological macromolecules and the plant optimization theory at different scales. Shrub patches and interspace may be considered as a water gathering system, in which entropy production is mainly caused by two processes: (1)soil water mixing in shrub patches and (2)either rainfall or outside runoff. For entropy flow, the main contributing factors are precipitation, evaporation, and transpiration processes in shrub patches. In this study, a modified model for a shrub patch ecosystem was built. It was applied to explain the moisture gathering in shrub patches. The model was based on the entropy change theory and Klausmier moisture gathering model, consisting of a pair of partial differential equations on soil moisture and plant biomass in the two-dimension plane. Based on the principle of maximum entropy production (MEP), the optimal ratio of shrub patches responding to different annual precipitation may be simulated. The simulation results showed a negative correlation between biomass and soil water content, which was verified by field experiments. When the ecosystem was steady (and the MEP principle was satisfied), the annual precipitation and the optimal ratio of shrub patches had a certain linear relationship. The existing data for Inner Mongolia was used to set up the model parameters, from which the optimal ratio of shrub patches responding to different annual precipitation values varying from 50 mm to 450 mm was simulated. Then the optimal shrub area ratios for practical application were determined in arid and semiarid regions. For example a region with 300 mm precipitation produced a shrub patch ratio of around 30%. This result provided theoretical support and practical guidance for ecosystem protection and plant recovery in arid and semiarid regions. The simulated values varied considerably, which may be because the effects of surface runoff were simplified to a linear relationship with precipitation in the modified model.

Since their homologue patterns discriminate between vegetation forms, they were increasingly used for paleovegetation reconstructions during the last years. However, before any robust interpretation of the long-chain n-alkane patterns in sediment archives, reference samples from modern vegetation and topsoil material should be investigated at a regional scale. Apart from some temperate and tropical regions, such systematic regional studies on modern plant and topsoil material are still largely lacking. To test the potential of leaf wax-derived n-alkane patterns for paleoenvironmental studies in the semi-humid to semi-arid central southern Caucasus region, we investigated the influence of different vegetation forms on the leaf wax n-alkane signal in modern plants and topsoil material (0-5 cm) from eastern Georgia. We sampled (i) sites with grassland/herbs that included steppe, cultivated grassland and meadows, and (ii) sites that are dominated by deciduous hornbeam forests. The results show that long-chain n-alkanes originate from leaf waxes of higher terrestrial plants and that their homologue pattern allow to discriminate between different vegetation forms: n-Alkanes derived from sites with grassland/herbs are mainly dominated by C31, while n-alkanes derived from sites with deciduous trees/shrubs show high abundances of C29. Thus, long-chain n-alkanes have a great potential when used for regional paleovegetation reconstructions. Moreover, the n-alkane distributions of the topsoils do not show correlations with mean annual temperatures and precipitation along the investigated transect. As degradation of organic matter can affect the leaf wax n-alkane distribution, we further present an updated end-member model that includes our results, accounts for degradation effects and enables semi-quantitative reconstructions of past vegetation changes in the central southern Caucasus region. © The Author(s) 2018.","Bliedtner, M.; Schäfer, I.K.; Von Suchodoletz, H.; Zech, R.","","15",2018,"","","","","","","","","",""

Our field observations and thin section characterizations of the Oligocene and Miocene continental carbonates in south Texas identified three types of pedogenic carbonates, including rhizoliths, carbonate nodules, and platy horizons, and two types of groundwater carbonates, including carbonate-cemented beds and carbonate concretions, with distinctive macromorphologic and micromorphologic features. Based on preservations of authigenic microfabrics and variations of carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions, we suggest these carbonates experienced minimal diagenesis, and their stable isotopic compositions reflect paleoclimate and paleoenvironment in south Texas. Our Oligocene and Miocene carbonate clumped isotope temperatures (T(Δ47)) are 23–28 °C, slightly less than or comparable to the range of modern mean annual and mean warm season air temperature (21–27 °C) in the study area. These T(Δ47) values do not show any dependency on carbonate-type, or trends through time suggesting that groundwater carbonates were formed at shallow depths. These data could indicate that air temperature in south Texas was relatively stable since the early Oligocene. The reconstructed paleo-surface water δ18O values are similar to modern surface water which could indicate that meteoric water δ18O values also remained stable since the early Oligocene. Mean pedogenic carbonate δ13C values increased ~ − 4.6‰ during the late Miocene, most likely reflecting an expansion of C4 grassland in south Texas.

Annual invasive species may be able to quickly evolve traits associated with drought escape or tolerance through rapid genetic changes. We investigated the influence of 5 years of water and nitrogen manipulations on trait values in a southern California grassland system. Seeds from two annual grass species (Avena barbata and Bromus madritensis) were collected from experimental plots and grown in a common environment over two generations. We measured 14 physiological, morphological, phenological and reproductive traits. Both species displayed phenotypic differences depending on the water treatment from which they were collected, but not depending on the nitrogen treatment. Both species displayed trait values characteristic of drought escape (e.g. earlier flowering in A. barbata and B. madritensis, lower water-use efficiency in B. madritensis) when grown from the seeds collected from plots that experienced five years of reduced precipitation. Furthermore, A. barbata individuals grown from the seeds collected from drought plots had higher reproductive output and higher photosynthetic performance than individuals grown from water addition plots, with individuals grown from ambient plots displaying intermediate trait values. Notably, we found no phenotypic variation among treatments for six root traits. Synthesis. Trait differences were observed following two generations in a common garden, suggesting that treatment differences were genetically based. This suggests that populations were responding to selection over the 5 years of water manipulations, a remarkably short time period. The rapid evolutionary responses observed here may help these two widespread invasive grass species thrive under reduced precipitation scenarios, which could have important implications for fire dynamics, invasive species management and native plant restoration in communities invaded by annual grasses. © 2016 The Authors.

It occurs as a northwest-southeast-trending swath ∼63 km in length and between 3 and 10 km in width, and is ∼70 m in thickness. The conglomerate consists of a matrix of arkosic coarse sand and granules along with pebble- to boulder-sized clasts that vary in abundance. Locally, the upper portion of the conglomerate is well exposed in cliffs and ledges and also in flat outcrops along drainages. Large to very large-scale cross- bedding, of both the planar and trough types, is characteristic of the unit. Clasts are dominantly Front Range granitic rocks and Wall Mountain Tuff, and boulders of the latter can exceed 0.5 m in diameter. Minor quantities of quartzite and vein quartz, and rare sedimentary clasts, also are present. The large sizes of the bedforms and clasts indicate deep water and high velocity during deposition. A recent, extensive paleocurrent study of the upper part of the conglomerate has produced a new map of the fluvial system, indicating a main, southeast-trending paleochannel with two major northeast-trending tributaries. This field trip will present an overview of the Castle Rock Conglomerate lithology, bedforms, and associated geologic units; ideas about its deposition; and its bearing on uplift along the Front Range and in the southwest Denver Basin. Planned stops will be in Douglas and Elbert Counties, south of Denver, and include Castlewood Canyon State Park, Prairie Canyon Ranch open space, private farm and ranch properties, and an inactive quarry.

Climate, drought, fire, and grazing represent agents of tree mortality during the late Cenozoic, but the interaction between drought and declining atmospheric carbon dioxide ([CO2]a) from high to near-starvation levels ~34 million years (Ma) ago has been overlooked. Here, this interaction frames our investigation of sapling mortality through the interdependence of hydraulic function, carbon limitation, and defense metabolism. Methods: We recreated a changing Cenozoic [CO2]a regime by growing Sequoia sempervirens trees within climate-controlled growth chambers at 1500, 500, or 200 ppm [CO2]a, capturing the decline toward minimum concentrations from 34 Ma. After 7 months, we imposed drought conditions and measured key physiological components linking carbon utilization, hydraulics, and defense metabolism as hypothesized interdependent mechanisms of tree mortality. Key results: Catastrophic failure of hydraulic conductivity, carbohydrate starvation, and tree death occurred at 200 ppm, but not 500 or 1500 ppm [CO2]a. Furthermore, declining [CO2]a reduced investment in carbon-rich foliar defense compounds that would diminish resistance to biotic attack, likely exacerbating mortality. Conclusions: Low-[CO2]a-driven tree mortality under drought is consistent with Pleistocene pollen records charting repeated Californian Sequoia forest contraction during glacial periods (180-200 ppm [CO2]a) and may even have contributed to forest retreat as grasslands expanded on multiple continents under low [CO2]a over the past 10 Ma. In this way, geologic intervals of low [CO2]a coupled with drought could impose a demographic bottleneck in tree recruitment, driving vegetation shifts through forest mortality. © 2013 Botanical Society of America.","Beerling, D.J.; Hudson, P.J.; Leake, J.R.; McDowell, N.G.; Quirk, J.","","100",2013,"Atmosphere-biosphere feedbacks; Carbon starvation; Drought; Elevated CO2; Forest die-off; Global change; Hydraulic failure; Low CO2; Sequoia sempervirens; Tree mortality","","","","","","","","",""

Environments affect the rate of maximum evolutionary change by influencing variation in relative fitness (i.e., the opportunity for selection, or I). Within- and transgenerational plastic environmental responses may affect I, speeding or slowing processes of local adaptation. Methods: We determined whether environmental factors affected the opportunity for selection (I) in Aegilops triuncialis (barbed goatgrass) by measuring I as a within- and transgenerational plastic response to two maternal glasshouse environments (serpentine/dry and loam/moist). We also determined whether this species' two most common genetic lineages (determined by DNA microsatellite length polymorphism) varied in response to glasshouse treatments. Key Results: Opportunity for selection was less for plants grown in the dry serpentine environment than for plants grown in the moist loam environment. This response varied between genetic lineages. The east lineage exhibited a within-generation response to the dry serpentine environment. For both seed mass and average seed weight in this lineage, the opportunity for selection was lower in dry serpentine than in moist loam. The west lineage had a transgenerational response to the dry serpentine such that the opportunity for selection for seed number and seed mass was lower for plants produced by mothers grown in dry serpentine than for plants produced by mothers in moist loam. Conclusions: Phenotypic variation in relative fitness is constrained by the dry serpentine environment, which leads to lower evolvability in this environment.

We explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of tree invasion of a montane meadow in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, where meadow loss is a conservation concern. We examine the early stages of invasion, where extrinsic and intrinsic processes can be clearly delineated. In a 0. 21-ha plot, we mapped and aged 929 trees ≥0. 3-m tall, yielding a detailed record of the spatio-temporal dynamics of invasion. For the primary species, Abies grandis and Pinus contorta, we correlated age structures (unimodal in both species) with climate (precipitation, temperature, and snowpack) and cone production, but found weak or non-significant relationships. Evidence of biotic interactions within and between species was obtained by examining the spatial associations of trees to a distance of 5 m and how these changed over time. We used multiple methods including uni- and bivariate forms of the Ripley's K and pair-correlation function (pcf) (corrected for inhomogeneity), the J-function, an evolving nearest-neighbor metric, and a test for directional bias in establishment. Pinus and Abies contributed in contrasting ways to the pace and spatial structure of invasion. Shade-intolerant Pinus tended to establish in the open, initiating clusters. In contrast, shade-tolerant Abies established in association with Pinus or in conspecific clusters. Preferential establishment of Abies to the north of older Pinus suggests that facilitation occurs by shading. The factors responsible for initial establishment remain unresolved, but positive interactions are pivotal in accelerating invasions, once initiated. Similar processes are likely to occur in other grasslands undergoing rapid conversion to woodland or forest. In combination, analyses of spatial and temporal patterns of establishment provide insight into the processes that structure invasions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Antos, J.A.; Halpern, C.B.; Jones, J.A.; Rice, J.M.","","213",2012,"Biotic interactions; Facilitation; Spatial point-pattern analysis; Tree invasion; Tree-tree interactions","","","","","","","","",""

These areas include shrublands, grasslands, and croplands, which represent 68% of the seasonally snowcovered Northern Hemisphere land surface (excluding Greenland). Snow depth observations throughout nonforested areas suggest that mid- to late-winter snowpack depths are often comparable or lower than the vegetation heights. As a consequence, vegetation protruding above the snow cover has an important impact on snow-season surface energy budgets. The protruding vegetation parameterization uses disparate energy balances for snow-covered and protruding vegetation fractions of each model grid cell, and fractionally weights these fluxes to define grid-average quantities. SnowModel, a spatially distributed snow-evolution modeling system, was used to test and assess the parameterization. Simulations were conducted during the winters of 2005/06 and 2006/07 for conditions of 1) no protruding vegetation (the control) and 2) with protruding vegetation. The spatial domain covered Colorado, Wyoming, and portions of the surrounding states; 81% of this area is nonforested. The surface net radiation, energy, and moisture fluxes displayed considerable differences when protruding vegetation was included. For shrubs, the net radiation, sensible, and latent fluxes changed by an average of 12.7, 6.9, and 222.7 W m-2, respectively. For grass and crops, these fluxes changed by an average of 6.9, 20.8, and 27.9 W m-22, respectively. Daily averaged flux changes were as much as 5 times these seasonal averages.

This information is critically needed for dominant species that largely determine the productivity of the central U.S. grassland. We established a reciprocal common garden experiment across a longitudinal gradient to test whether ecotypic variation interacts with the environment to affect growth and nitrogen (N) storage in a dominant grass. We predicted plant growth would increase from west to east, corresponding with increasing precipitation, but differentially among ecotypes due to local adaptation in all ecotypes and a greater range of growth response in ecotypes originating from west to east. We quantified aboveground biomass, root biomass, belowground net primary production (BNPP), root C:N ratio, and N storage in roots of three ecotypes of Andropogon gerardii collected from and reciprocally planted in central Kansas, eastern Kansas, and southern Illinois. Only the ecotype from the most mesic region (southern Illinois) exhibited more growth from west to east. There was evidence for local adaptation in the southern Illinois ecotype by means of the local vs. foreign contrast within a site and the home vs. away contrast when growth in southern Illinois was compared to the most distant site in central Kansas. Root biomass of the eastern Kansas ecotype was higher at home than at either away site. The ecotype from the driest region, central Kansas, exhibited the least response across the environmental gradient, resulting in a positive relationship between the range of biomass response and precipitation in ecotype region of origin. Across all sites, ecotypes varied in root C:N ratio (highest in the driest-origin ecotype) and N storage in roots (highest in the most mesic-origin ecotype). The low and limited range of biomass, higher C:N ratio of roots, and lower N storage in the central Kansas ecotype relative to the southern Illinois ecotype suggests that introducing ecotypes of A. gerardii from much drier regions into highly mesic prairie would reduce productivity and alter belowground ecosystem processes under a wide range of conditions. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.","Baer, S.G.; Johnson, L.C.; Maricle, B.R.; Mendola, M.L.","","96",2015,"Andropogon gerardii; Ecosystem function; Ecotype; Local adaptation; Productivity; Restoration; Roots","","","","","","","","",""

For the past -10,400 yr, the lake never became shallow enough to allow large numbers of benthic and epiphytic diatoms to become deposited in the center of the lake. The relatively great depth of Elk Lake throughout this time is consistent with the continuous presence of varves in the record and the predominantly autochthonous character of sediment in the profunda! part of the lake. The planktonic diatom assemblages are dominated by two species, Fragilaria crotonensis and Stephanodiscus minutulus. They alternate in dominance on scales of hundreds to thousands of years and indicate shifting limnological conditions under subtle climatic control. Fragilaria crotonensis is typically a summer and early-fall diatom that prospers when supplies of silicon are high compared to those of phosphorus. Stephanodiscus minutulus blooms in the early spring when circulation provides abundant phosphorus. The alternation of these two diatoms reflects principally the climatic conditions that drive spring circulation and summer stagnation and thereby control the fluxes of silicon and phosphorus to and within the lake. Cold and dry climates in late spring and early summer promote blooms of S. minutulus, and hot summers with some frontal storm activity provide conditions suitable for F. crotonensis. The mid-Holocene prairie period (8.2 to 4.0 ka) is characterized by a greatly increased diatom accumulation rate and a general dominance of S. minutulus. Between 6.4 and 4.0 ka Aulacoseira ambigua became prominent, implying increased nutrient fluxes and summer turbulence, probably related to winds and storms in that season. Lake levels were probably lower at times during this period. This part of the Holocene, however, was interrupted by a 600 yr interval of moister and warmer climates (5.4 to 4.8 ka), with low diatom influx and a dominance of F. crotonensis. After 4.0 ka diatom productivity fell, and F. crotonensis tended to dominate in response to reduced spring circulation and probably increased precipitation. The Little Ice Age, between A.D. 1450 and 1850, is documented by increased abundances of 5. minutulus, indicating cooler late spring conditions. Logging activities in the vicinity of Elk Lake in the early twentieth century allowed Aulacoseira ambigua to return by increasing turbulence and nutrient fluxes to the lake.","Bradbury, J.P.; Dieterich-Rurup, K.V.","","276",1993,"","","","","","","","","",""

The ash deposits are contained within four land resource regions, the Southern and Central High Plains, the High Plains Breaks, the Rolling Red Plains, and the Reddish Prairies. Extensive Middle Pleistocene constructional stream terrace surfaces occur within the Rolling Red Plains. Multiple stream terrace surfaces were recognized across the study area with the highest level being dated Early Pleistocene to Pliocene and the lowest bordering the Holocene floodplains.

The Truckee River provided most of the water used in the basin in 2000 while groundwater supplied about 27 percent. The complex basin-fill aquifer system, consisting of both unconsolidated Quaternary and Tertiary sediments, is under both leaky-confined and unconfined conditions. The aquifer is recharged naturally by the infiltration of Truckee River water, precipitation falling on the surrounding mountains and basin margins, and by human-related sources of water in the valley, such as seepage from surface-water diversions and excess irrigation water. Natural recharge to the basin-fill aquifer in Truckee Meadows is estimated at about 31,600 acre-ft/yr. Groundwater generally flows from recharge areas in the west and south toward the Truckee River and Steamboat Creek, which may receive relatively minor amounts of groundwater seepage, and to discharge areas in the center of the valley where the water is lost to ET. Human-related changes to the Truckee Meadows groundwater flow system began in the late 1800s when water diverted from the Truckee River for irrigation increased recharge to the basin-fill aquifer. By the early 1960s, seepage from excess irrigation water and canal losses to the groundwater system almost doubled the quantity of recharge from that of predevelopment conditions and resulted in a rise in groundwater levels, an increase in the volume of water stored in the aquifer, and an increase in groundwater discharge through ET and seepage to streams. The area of irrigated agriculture in the basin has decreased since the 1960s, resulting in a decrease in recharge associated with irrigation, although this decrease was accompanied by an increase in municipal groundwater pumping since the late 1950s. Groundwater quality in the Truckee Meadows basin is influenced by both natural and human-induced factors. The addition of recharge sources at the land surface and increased pumping from wells facilitates the movement of water and contaminants to parts of the aquifer used for water supply. Areas most susceptible to the movement of water and any included contaminants from land surface are in the western part of the basin and near the Truckee River, where the confining layers are likely to be thin, discontinuous, or not present. Groundwater near the Truckee River and other streams entering the basin typically has dissolved-solids concentrations less than 300 mg/L. Sodium-chloride groundwater with high dissolved-solids concentrations occur in geothermal areas within the basin. These geothermal systems have contributed to naturally high arsenic concentrations in water from the basin-fill deposits and from springs issuing from volcanic rock. Arsenic in groundwater also can come from the volcanic rocks bounding the basin and from the sediment derived from these rocks. Concentrations of arsenic in water from 23 wells sampled by the NAWQA Program, mostly in the central and northeastern parts of the basin, exceeded the drinking-water standard for arsenic of 10 μg/L.Reducing conditions in the aquifer likely affect nitrate concentrations through denitrification, although elevated concentrations measured in groundwater in the southern part of Truckee Meadows were attributed to the recharge of septic system effluent. At least one pesticide was detected in 68 percent of the shallow monitoring wells and in 44 percent of the water-supply wells in the basin sampled by NAWQA. Volatile organic compounds were detected in water sampled from 50 percent of the shallow monitoring wells and 39 percent of the supply wells sampled.

Changing [CO2]a affects plant carbon-water balance, with implications for growth, drought tolerance and vegetation shifts. The evolution of C4 photosynthesis improved plant hydraulic function under low [CO2]a and preluded the establishment of savannahs, characterized by rapid transitions between open C4-dominated grassland with scattered trees and closed forest. Understanding directional vegetation trends in response to environmental change will require modelling. But models are often parameterized with characteristics observed in plants under current climatic conditions, necessitating experimental quantification of the mechanistic underpinnings of plant acclimation to [CO2]a. Methods: We measured growth, photosynthesis and plant-water relations, within wetting-drying cycles, of a C3 tree (Vachellia karroo, an acacia) and a C4 grass (Eragrostis curvula) grown at 200, 400 or 800 ppm [CO2]a. We investigated the mechanistic linkages between trait responses to [CO2]a under moderate soil drying, and photosynthetic characteristics. Key results: For V. karroo, higher [CO2]a increased assimilation, foliar carbon:nitrogen, biomass and leaf starch, but decreased stomatal conductance and root starch. For Eragrostis, higher [CO2]a decreased C:N, did not affect assimilation, biomass or starch, and markedly decreased stomatal conductance. Together, this meant that C4 advantages in efficient water-use over the tree were maintained with rising [CO2]a. Conclusions: Acacia and Eragrostis acclimated differently to [CO2]a, with implications for their respective responses to water limitation and environmental change. Our findings question the carbon-centric focus on factors limiting assimilation with changing [CO2]a, how they are predicted and their role in determining productivity.

That vegetation boundary shifted as a result of Holocene climatic change and fire suppression following Euroamerican settlement, but the timescale of soil response to those vegetation changes and the factors that influence it are poorly known. On steep colluvial slopes of southeastern Minnesota, Mollisols with thick, dark A horizons typically associated with grassland are found today under deciduous forest. Soils with much thinner and/or lighter-colored A horizons occur immediately up- and downslope of the forest-covered Mollisols. Most of the soils with thick A horizons are not in topographic settings found to favor organic matter accumulation in other landscapes. Principal component analysis highlights important axes of textural and mineralogical variation among horizons of these soils, often related to parent material properties. Soils with and without thick A horizons are separated along one principal component heavily loaded by high pH, reflecting the presence of dolomite fragments in the hillslope sediment that soils with thick, dark A horizons formed in. Stable C isotope analysis reveals that the Mollisols with thick, dark A horizons under forest had C input from vegetation with abundant C4 grasses in the past. Public land survey data also indicate replacement of grassland or savanna by forest since 1854 on colluvial slopes where forest-covered Mollisols occur today. We propose that the soils with thick, dark A horizons under forest today reflect a lagged response to vegetation change, from grassland or savanna to closed forest. Their thick A horizons and some C4-derived organic matter may be preserved because dolomite weathering releases abundant Ca++ and Mg++ that favor aggregation and organic matter stabilization. Soils with thin A horizons just up- or downslope may also have formed partly under grasses, but have responded more quickly and/or more substantially to vegetation change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..","Gruley, K.E.; Hanson, P.R.; Jacobs, P.M.; Mason, J.A.; Reyerson, P.","","275",2016,"Alfisols; C isotopes; Mollisols; Parent material; Soil response to vegetation change","","","","","","","","",""

Although conversion from prairie to agriculture occurred a century ago, recent decades have seen increased subsurface tile drainage, annual row crop coverage and channel modifications, particularly at road crossings such that channel adjustment is ongoing. Channel evolution in Elm and Center Creeks, two fourth-order streams in the Blue Earth River basin, was studied to understand relationships between changes in channel morphology and suspended sediment concentrations. The construction of drainage ditches and expanded subsurface tiling has connected isolated basins to stream channels, effectively increasing drainage areas of Elm and Center Creeks by 15-20%. Sinuosity has been reduced by grading and drainage of first-order sloughs, channel straightening at road crossings and natural cut-offs and agricultural ditching that have shortened Elm Creek by 15% between 1938 and 2003. Stream cross-sectional area was enlarged in response to the land-use and drainage changes. In the headwaters, public ditches are wider than historic channels and entrenched by berms. Unchannelized headwater and upper mainstem portions of Elm Creek are also highly entrenched (up to 1.07 meters below the pre-channelization bed elevation with a bank height ratio>1.5) but have not widened substantially. In contrast, the lower main channel has widened by an average of 68%. These channel adjustments contribute to the suspended sediment load and violations of Minnesota's turbidity and Index of Biotic Integrity standards. The watershed has a low sediment delivery ratio because it is a flat, poorly connected landscape and likely delivers less sediment to the Minnesota River than steeper rivers downstream, such as the Blue Earth River. Entrenchment and increased sediment transport capacity in the lower reaches of the river have lead to increased sediment delivery to the downstream Blue Earth and Minnesota rivers.

They carry xenocrysts and rare xenoliths derived from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) and the deep crust. U-Pb age dating of groundmass perovskite in the Prairie Creek lamproites gives a poorly constrained Cretaceous age. U-Pb dating and in situ Sr and Nd isotope data show that perovskite micronodules in the Twin Knobs #2 lamprophyre are ca. 600 Ma old, and may represent samples of rift-relatedalkalic magmas derived from a juvenile mantle. A lithologic section constructed from the mantle-derived xenocrysts shows a moderately depleted SCLM that has experienced a high degree of melt-related metasomatism, especially in the depth range 150 to 140 km. In situ Re-Os analysis of sulfide grains in the xenoliths yields model ages ranging up to 3.4 Ga, with major peaks at 1.4-1.5 Ga and 200-300 Ma. Early Paleoproterozoic model ages appear to reflect mixing between residual Archeanhigh-Os sulfides and later low-Os sulfide melts. These data suggest that the SCLM beneath the Prairie Creek area formed in Archean time, and has been progressively refertilized by a series of magmatic events, which appear to correlate in time with events in the overlying crust. The Archean SCLM sampled by the lamproites may represent the mantle root of the Sabine microcontinent, which lies mainly to the south of the lamproite field and is recognizable in seismic tomography as a feature with higher shearwave velocity (Vs) (100-175 km depth). Seismic tomography also shows several blocks with high Vs beneath the Grenville province to the east, which may represent other microcontinental blocks. These findings suggest that the growth of individual continents is significantly affected by the accretion of older microcontinental blocks, and that the extent of early continental crust therefore may be greater than generally estimated. © 2011 Geological Society of America.","Begg, G.C.; Dunn, D.; Griffin, W.L.; Karlstrom, K.; Natapov, L.M.; O'Reilly, S.Y.","","123",2011,"","","","","","","","","",""

The dominance of invasive species is often assumed to reflect their competitive superiority over displaced native species. However, invasive species may be abundant because of their greater tolerance to anthropogenic impacts accompanying their introduction. Thus, invasive species can either be the drivers or passengers of change. 2. We distinguish between these two possibilities in California grasslands currently dominated by Mediterranean annuals (exotics) and subjected to livestock grazing since European settlement. We focused on native annual grasses and forbs, an understudied species-rich component of the California flora, and Mediterranean annual grasses, currently dominant and among the first non-native plants introduced to the area. 3. We established a field experiment with fenced and unfenced blocks in a cattle pasture. We measured concentrations of limiting resources (nitrogen, phosphorus, light and soil moisture) in monoculture plots as an index of competitive ability (i.e. R*). We then quantified grazing impacts on biomass and seed production in grazed vs. ungrazed monoculture plots. Finally, we measured biomass and seed production of each species competing in mixture plots, in the presence and absence of grazers. 4. We found that native and exotic species did not differ in R* indices of competitive ability, i.e. concentrations of limiting resources in ungrazed native monoculture plots did not differ from concentrations in ungrazed exotic monoculture plots. By contrast, exotic annuals suffered less from grazing than native annuals, perhaps reflecting their longer evolutionary history with cattle grazing. Consistent with these results, native and exotic annuals were equally abundant in ungrazed mixtures, but exotic species overwhelmingly dominated grazed mixtures. 5. Species able to draw down nitrogen and light to lower levels in monocultures (i.e. those with lower R* values) dominated biomass and seeds in mixed plots without grazers. However, R* did not predict the relative abundance of species in grazed plots. Moreover, the relative abundance of species in mixtures did not correlate with grazing impacts on their monocultures, implying that grazing alters inter-specific competitive dynamics. 6. Synthesis. We demonstrate that the displacement of native annuals by Mediterranean annual grasses in California may largely have been driven by cattle grazing. © 2010 The Authors.

Prescribed burning should be applied widely, but under experimental conditions that facilitate studying its impacts on birds and other components of biodiversity. Exceptions are Sonoran, Mojave, and Chihuahuan desert scrub, and riparian woodlands, where the increased fuel loads caused by invasions of exotic grasses and trees have increased the frequency and intensity of wildfires that now are generally destructive to native vegetation. Fire once played a critical role in maintaining a balance between herbaceous and woody vegetation in desert grasslands, and in providing a short-term stimulus to forb and seed production. A 3-5 yr fire-return interval likely will sustain most desert grassland birds, but large areas should remain unburned to serve species dependent upon woody vegetation. Understory fire once maintained relatively open oak savanna, pinyon-juniper, pine-oak, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and low elevation mixed-conifer forests and their bird assemblages, but current fuel conditions are more likely to result in stand-replacement fires outside the range of natural variation. Prescribed burning, thinning, and grazing management will be needed to return fire to its prehistoric role in these habitats. Fire also should be applied in high elevation mixed-conifer forests, especially to increase aspen stands that are important for many birds, but this will be an especially difficult challenge in an ecosystem where stand-replacement fires are natural events. Overall, surprisingly little is known about avian responses to southwestern fires, except as can be inferred from fire effects on vegetation. We call for cooperation between managers and researchers to replicate burns in appropriate habitats that will permit rigorous study of community and population-demographic responses of breeding, migrating, and wintering birds. This research is critical and urgent, given the present threat to many southwestern ecosystems from destructive wildfires, and the need to develop fire management strategies that not only reduce risk but also sustain bird populations and other components of southwestern biological diversity.","Block, W.M.; Bock, C.E.","","",2005,"Birds; Chaparral; Desert; Fire; Grassland; Mixed-conifer; Pine-oak; Prescribed burning; Riparian; Savanna; Southwest; Wildfire","","","","","","","","",""

Treeline ecotones, such as the prairie-forest boundary, represent climatically sensitive regions where the relative abundance of vegetation types is controlled by complex interactions between climate and local factors. Responses of vegetation and fire to climate change may be tightly linked as a result of strong feedbacks among fuel production, vegetation structure and fire frequency/severity, but the importance of these feedbacks for controlling the stability of this ecotone is unclear. 2. In this study, we examined the prairie-forest ecotone in south-central Minnesota using two lake sediment cores to reconstruct independent records of climate, vegetation and fire over the past 12 500 years. Using pollen, charcoal, sediment magnetic analyses and LOI properties, we investigated whether fires were controlled directly by climate or indirectly by fuel production. 3. Sediment magnetic and LOI data suggest four broad climatic periods occurring c. 11 350-8250 BP (cool/humid), c. 8250-4250 BP (warm/dry), c. 4250-2450 BP (warm/ humid), and c. 2450-0 BP (cool/humid), indicating that, since the mid-Holocene, climate has shifted towards wetter conditions favouring greater in-lake production and fuel production on the landscape. 4. The area surrounding both lakes was characterized by boreal forest c. 12 500-10 000 BP, changing to an Ulmus-Ostrya forest c. 10 000-9000 BP, changing to a community dominated by prairie (Poaceae-Ambrosia-Artemisid) and deciduous forest taxa c. 8000-4250 BP, and finally shifting to a Quercus-dominated woodland/savanna beginning c. 4250-3000 BP. 5. Charcoal influx increased from an average of 0.11-0.62 mm2 cm-2 year-1 during the early Holocene forest period (c. 11 350-8250 BP) to 1.71-3.36 mm2 cm-2 year-1 during the period of prairie expansion (c. 8250-4250 BP) and again increased to 4.18-4.90 mm2 cm-2 year-1 at the start of the woodland/savanna period (c. 4250 BP). 6.

The basal Rattlesnake Formation (ca. 7.5-7.3 Ma) has a suite of weakly calcareous paleosols indicating subhumid paleoclimate (800-1000 mm mean annual precipitation or MAP) and seasonal waterlogging. A shift at ca. 7.3 Ma to semi-arid paleoclimate (MAP 500-850) is indicated by paleosols with calcic horizons at depths of 105-85 cm. A second shift at ca. 7.2 Ma ushered in an assemblage of soils with shallow (36-53 cm) calcic horizons, indicating semi-arid conditions (MAP 200-600 mm) not much different from today. Along with the climatic shifts documented by the paleosols there also are substantial changes in alluvial architecture and paleotopography. The lower Rattlesnake Formation (ca. 7.5-7.2 Ma) was deposited by a stream flowing northeast in an ancestral John Day Valley. The upper part of the formation (ca. 7.2-7.1 Ma) was deposited within large alluvial fans shed from the growing anticline of Picture Gorge Basalt to the north. Stepwise changes in former vegetation can also be interpreted from paleosols. The basal Rattlesnake Formation (7.5-7.3 Ma) has a suite of paleosols with root traces, clay skins and manganese nodules like those of riparian woodland and seasonally waterlogged riparian meadow. The succeeding paleoclimatic sequence (7.3-7.2 Ma) includes the earliest known mollic paleosols with deep (> 50 cm) calcareous nodules, interpreted as former soils of tall grassland. Also found are manganese-stained paleosols of seasonally waterlogged meadows, and weakly developed paleosols of early successional riparian vegetation. A later paleoclimatic sequence (7.2-7.1 Ma) includes desert shrubland paleosols, as well as paleosols of early successional riparian vegetation. Fossil bones and teeth found in many paleosols indicate coeval changes in mammalian faunas. The major shift from woodland to grassland at ca. 7.3 Ma introduced into this area tall grassland ecosystems, including large cursorial horses and pronghorns. Aridification continued with the shift to shrubland ca. 7.2 Ma (early Hemphillian), which corresponds to continent-wide mass extinction of most remaining browsing mammals from the Clarendonian Chronofauna. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Disturbance intensity was defined by survival of the dominant grass species (Bouteloua gracilis) after an outbreak of root feeding activity by white grubs. Sixteen patches of vegetation consisting of four pairs of adjacent ungrazed-grazed by cattle locations with two replicates that were recently affected by white grubs were selected in 1977. Disturbance intensity was determined in 1977 by the area in each patch that contained live tillers of B. gracilis. Permanent plots were located both within and outside of each patch. Plant basal cover and density by species were estimated at time of peak aboveground biomass in six different years on each plot. Successional dynamics on patches was similar to areas affected by other types of disturbances, however, rate of recovery was faster for patches affected by grubs. Grazing by cattle was infrequently important to plant recovery, a result similar to effects of grazing on other aspects of shortgrass steppe ecosystems. Disturbance intensity was important to recovery of B. gracilis since tiller survival in 1977 was linearly related to cover in each year of sampling. For ungrazed patches, initial conditions were important to recovery of B. gracilis for as many as 14 years. For grazed patches, initial conditions decreased and grazing increased in importance through time. Changes in resource quality and a more uniform distribution of roots due to grazing likely resulted in more complete mortality of plants by grubs under grazed compared to ungrazed conditions. Persistence of shortgrass ecosystems in spite of disturbances with different intensities are determined at least in part by characteristics of disturbances interacting with the ability of plants to respond, and in part by the evolutionary history of the system. Although white grubs affect shortgrass communities infrequently, they have large and important effects on plant community structure through time, and represent an important class of disturbance defined by intensity.","Coffin, D.P.; Lauenroth, W.K.; Laycock, W.A.","","139",1998,"Bouteloua gracilis; Cattle grazing; June beetle larvae; Root feeders; Shortgrass steppe; Succession","","","","","","","","",""

Marl in a varved deep-basin (29.6 m) core consists mainly of calcite precipitated from surface waters during the summer and probably provides the least complicated isotope record. Marl in a sublittoral (10 m) core consists of calcite contributed from several inorganic and organic sources and probably is the most complicated of the three isotope records. Calcite from shells of the ostracod Candona ohioensis in the sublittoral core provides a record of shallow-water conditions in Elk Lake for the period between 10,500 and 5500 varve yr. Variations in the 13C:12C ratio of organic carbon deposited in Elk Lake during the Holocene are recorded in organic matter in the deep-basin core. All three oxygen isotope records show that, in general, the 18O:16O ratio in carbonate was enriched in , :18O by several parts per mil during the mid-Holocene relative to the past few thousand years. This pattern of oxygen isotope variation is similar to that observed for carbonate materials from other lakes in the northeastern and north-central United States. Oxygen isotope records from these other lakes also show that the 18Q.16Q ratio during the early Holocene was lower than during the mid-Holocene, and this pattern has been interpreted as representing a response to a generally warmer and drier climate during the mid-Holocene beginning about 8000 varve yr (the so-called hypsithermal). Ostracod and diatom assemblages from Elk Lake cores show, however, that the lake was colder and more saline than at present until at least 6700 varve yr, with conditions similar to those that exist today in cold prairie lakes of Canada. It may be more appropriate, therefore, to refer to the mid-Holocene in northwestern Minnesota as the ""prairie period"" rather than the hypsithermal, indicating that the climate was drier, but with no connotation regarding temperature. The oxygen isotope data from the three Elk Lake records for this period are somewhat equivocal. Values of δ : 16O in the marl from the sublittoral core and shells of Candona increase from 10,000 to about 6800 varve yr. However, values of δ : 16O in the marl that accumulated in the deepest part of the lake over the same interval (10,000-6800 varve yr) are more or less constant and enriched in l sO; this probably reflects the cold, saline prairie-lake conditions predicted from the ostracod and diatom assemblage data. All three oxygen isotope records show decreases in 18O:16O ratios after about 6800 varve yr in response to an increase in temperature and decrease in salinity of the lake. The 13C:12C ratios in carbonates from all three Elk Lake records show a distinct pattern; the ratio increased gradually from 10,000 to 8000 varve yr going into the mid-Holocene prairie period and then decreased gradually coming out of the prairie period between about 5500 and 2500 varve yr. These changes in the I3C:12C ratio could have been related to temperature through its effect on solubility of carbon dioxide; however, this interpretation is not supported by the oxygen isotope data. Another possibility is that changes in the : 13C: :12 ratio are related to organic productivity that removes 13C-depleted organic carbon and results in 13C-enriched surface waters. This interpretation implies that organic productivity was higher in Elk Lake during the mid-Holocene prairie period. Support for the high-productivity, 13-enriched surface-water model for the mid- Holocene prairie period in Elk Lake is provided by changes in the 13C:,2C ratio of organic carbon in the deep-basin core. These changes parallel almost exactly those in the 13C:,2C ratio of carbonate carbon, but are about 2°/00 larger (about 60/00 as opposed to about 4'7oo for carbonate carbon). The difference of about 2°/oo may represent 13C depletion due to CO2 limitation. The percentage of organic carbon in the sediment did not increase during the prairie period because it was diluted by an increased flux of detrital clastic material. The ultimate burial rate of organic carbon increased considerably, however, indicating that organic productivity was higher and/or the degree of preservation increased. Diatom assemblages and plant-pigment concentrations indicate that productivity was higher during the prairie period. Pvrolysis hydrogen and oxygen indices show that the 13C-enriched organic matter that accumulated during the prairie period was hydrogen rich and oxygen poor relative to organic matter that accumulated before and after. These two indices demonstrate that the organic matter that accumulated during the prairie period was much better preserved.","E. Dean, W.; Stuiver, M.","","276",1993,"","","","","","","","","",""

Here we describe the short-term dynamics of ecosystem physiology in experimental stands of native (Heteropogon contortus) and invasive (Eragrostis lehmanniana) grasses to an irrigation pulse across two geomorphic surfaces with distinctly different soils: a Pleistocene-aged surface with high clay content in a strongly horizonated soil, and a Holocene-aged surface with low clay content in homogenously structured soils. We evaluated whole-ecosystem and leaf-level CO2 and H2O exchange, soil CO2 efflux, along with plant and soil water status to understand potential constraints on whole-ecosystem carbon exchange during the initiation of the summer monsoon season. Prior to the irrigation pulse, both invasive and native grasses had less negative pre-dawn water potentials (Ψpd), greater leaf photosynthetic rates (Anet) and stomatal conductance (gs), and greater rates of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) on the Pleistocene surface than on the Holocene. Twenty-four hours following the experimental application of a 39 mm irrigation pulse, soil CO2 efflux increased leading to all plots losing CO2 to the atmosphere over the course of a day. Invasive species stands had greater evapotranspiration rates (ET) immediately following the precipitation pulse than did native stands, while maximum instantaneous NEE increased for both species and surfaces at roughly the same rate. The differential ET patterns through time were correlated with an earlier decline in NEE in the invasive species as compared to the native species plots. Plots with invasive species accumulated between 5% and 33% of the carbon that plots with the native species accumulated over the 15-day pulse period. Taken together, these results indicate that system CO2 efflux (both the physical displacement of soil CO2 by water along with plant and microbial respiration) strongly controls whole-ecosystem carbon exchange during precipitation pulses. Since CO2 and H2O loss to the atmosphere was partially driven by species effects on soil microclimate, understanding the mechanistic relationships between the soil characteristics, plant ecophysiological responses, and canopy structural dynamics will be important for understanding the effects of shifting precipitation and vegetation patterns in semi-arid environments. © Springer-Verlag 2003.","Cable, J.M.; Eilts, J.A.; English, N.B.; Huxman, T.E.; Ignace, D.D.; Weltzin, J.; Williams, D.G.","","141",2004,"Evapotranspiration; Invasive species; Net ecosystem exchange; Precipitation manipulation; Santa Rita Experimental Range","","","","","","","","",""

In mixed-grass prairie, invasive plants are often successful in relatively wet, nitrogen-rich areas, and areas protected from grazing. Dalmatian toadflax, a common invader of mixed-grass prairie, can also be favored by high water and nitrogen availability, but is thought to be relatively unpalatable to cattle, and therefore favored by grazing. We used spatially-adjusted model selection techniques to quantify relationships between toadflax cover (measured using very high-resolution aerial imagery), and relative snow deposition (estimated with a blowing snow model), slope, aspect, soil texture, and grazing intensity (estimated by proximity to water tanks). Toadflax was common throughout the 400 ha study site, occurring in 742 of 1,861 images. Toadflax cover was high on steeper slopes, particularly those with southern aspects. These two topographic variables were more effective in explaining toadflax distribution than modeled snow deposition, suggesting that factors other than snow deposition cause toadflax invasion on south-facing slopes. Toadflax cover was also high in areas further from water tanks, indicating that grazing may inhibit toadflax invasion. More broadly, this result suggests that grazing can reduce invasion of even relatively unpalatable species in ecosystems with long evolutionary histories of grazing. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The New England landscape has undergone a complete transformation as forests were converted to agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries followed by succession to woodland as a result of widespread agricultural abandonment. Despite the prevalence of human impacts, the effect and longevity of land-use practices on modern forest conditions are poorly understood. In the present study of pitch pine-scrub oak vegetation on a sand plain in the Connecticut Valley of Massachusetts, we address the following questions: (1) what is the relative importance of human and natural disturbance and environmental factors in controlling vegetation composition, structure, and landscape patterns; (2) what are the mechanisms underlying human impacts on vegetation, and what is the duration of these impacts; and (3) what are the implications of land-use history for the interpretation and conservation of these communities? Sand plain vegetation was selected for investigation because the homogeneity of site conditions facilitates the interpretation of land-use and natural disturbance impacts, and because the uncommon vegetation and constituent species are priorities for conservation efforts. Paleoecological data suggest that pre-European fires were common on the study area, perhaps ignited by a large regional Indian population. The area was noted historically as an extensive pine plain and was used for wood products from the 18th to the mid-19th century. Eighty-two percent of the area was subsequently plowed for agriculture before being abandoned in the early 20th century. Soil analyses confirm the homogeneity of site conditions and suggest that land uses (plowing, woodlot/pasture) were determined according to ownership pattern rather than site factors. Previously cultivated parcels have distinct Ap (plow horizons) 15-33 cm deep, whereas uncultivated parcels have A horizons 3-10 cm in depth. Soil physical and chemical characteristics are similar among land uses and modern vegetation types. Aerial photographs document a dramatic transformation in plant cover over the last 50 yr. In 1939, the vegetation was grassland or shrub-heath (49%), open-canopy forest (29%), and scrub-oak shrublands (15%). In 1985, 73% of the study area was forested with pitch pine (40%), hardwood (12%), or mixed stands (21%), 9% was in open-canopy stands, and 3% was covered by grass or shrubs. Vegetation/land-use relations are striking. Pitch pine occurs almost exclusively (97%) on former plowed sites, whereas scrub oak stands occur preferentially (89%) on sites that have not been plowed. Land use explains the greatest variation in modern vegetation as well as the distribution and abundance of many taxa. Fire has been common across the study area but has influenced vegetation largely within patterns resulting from prior land use. Land-use patterns and factors controlling vegetation composition and structure are broadly paralleled at similar sites elsewhere in the Connecticut Valley. The study indicates that conservation biologists interested in preserving species, communities, and landscape patterns on sand plains in the northeastern United States need to incorporate a dynamic perspective of biological systems that includes the overriding impact of prior land use.

By the early 20th century, landscape evolution concepts, stratigraphic models, and regional syntheses had developed for most areas. The 1944 monograph of H.N. Fisk marks the advent of a predictive stratigraphic and landscape evolution model that links form and process to a predominantly glacio-eustatic mechanism. The Fiskian model gained widespread acceptance, and decades passed before significant alternate models began to emerge. Revised stratigraphic and geomorphic concepts are presently developing from newly acquired environmental and engineering data. Present scenarios classify Pleistocene outcrop areas into erosional and constructional landscapes, and veneers of eolian, colluvial, fluvial, coastal, and marine origin can drape both types of surfaces. The southern LMV and adjacent Gulf Coastal Plain (GCP) experienced significant landscape change during the Pleistocene. Late Tertiary (Pliocene?) to Early Pleistocene deposition of the Upland Complex was by streams with a high sand and gravel load relative to its mud load. The regional drainage network and fluvial system behavior was probably significantly different from the modern. Braided stream alluvial fan complexes received sediment from highland source areas adjacent to the LMV and the glaciated mid-continent. It is plausible that part of Upland Complex deposition predates initial glacial advances. From Early to Middle Pleistocene, an erosional landscape formed during a dissection period that chiefly postdates soil formation on stable landscape positions of the Upland Complex. Slope evolution truncated a regionally extensive geosol in multiple phases, and parts of the erosion surface complex are graded to the oldest preserved constructional alluvial plains in present valleys. Toe and foot slope positions of the erosion surface complex and its correlative alluvial plains are presently delineated as the Intermediate Complex. Constructional landscapes formed at this time are sparsely preserved; Fisk's Montgomery Terrace in the Lower Red River Valley (LRRV) is the best preserved example. Influences on the development of erosion surfaces in the LMV are not well understood; however interactions of relative sea level fall, climate change, and epirogenic crustal movement are plausible factors. From the latter part of Middle Pleistocene to the Holocene, there was widespread evolution of modern constructional landscapes. Constructional alluviation preserved lithofacies of mixed load, laterally accreting, meandering streams that developed over large areas of the southern LMV to form parts of the Prairie Complex. Lateral planation in valleys and stable rates of upland sediment generation were dominant processes during Prairie Complex deposition. Pleistocene stratigraphic examples considered important by Fisk are still considered relevant to modern stratigraphic investigators. Presently, Pleistocene units of the southern LMV, the adjacent LRRV, and central GCP can be correlated only by relative stratigraphic relationships. Refined chronostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental models for these areas would help improve the understanding of the geomorphic influences on Quaternary landscape evolution in the region.","Autin, W.J.","","45",1996,"","","","","","","","","",""

Despite prevailing regional aridity since the mid-Miocene, data show that early hominins Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Orrorin tugenensis, and Ardipithecus ramidus lived in environments made of mosaics of grasslands, mixed grasslands, woodlands, and forests, where wooded habitats were maintained by edaphic rather than regional (climatic) humidity. Groundwater systems (springs, seeps, shallow aquifers) and surface water (rivers, lakes), locally create wetter and more wooded environments in addition to that supported by precipitation alone. However, edaphically sustained woodlands are rare to missing in most published paleoeclogical interpretations of hominin archeological sites. To explore the importance of groundwater to the record of hominins in Africa, we provide newly acquired field data from spring sites in the Awash Valley, Ethiopia, and Lake Eyasi-Lake Manyara region, Tanzania, and re-evaluate published data from the Ardipithecus-bearing Aramis Member, Ethiopia. Results show that (1) in arid Eastern Africa, a wide variety of microhabitats such as groundwater-fed wetlands, Hyphaene palm woodlands, Phoenix reclinata palm woodlands, and structurally complex and species-rich forest patches exist due to local variability of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic conditions. (2) These microhabitats carry some characteristic pollen and phytolith signals, that may be easily masked by the signal of surrounding grass-dominated shrublands and grasslands. (3) The Aramis Member (Awash Valley, Ethiopia), which is to date, the best documented paleo-groundwater ecosystem, is not a riparian habitat. It is one of > 50 examples (within 22 geographically distinct areas) in Africa and the Middle East where evidence of groundwater systems co-exist with hominin and/or archeological remains. Springs are commonly localized features of limited area within a landscape, but provide ecological continuity through time and diverse microhabitats, some of which may be densely forested. At the local scale, springs create microclimates, distinctive vegetation, and increase soil nutrients, species richness, structural complexity, and provide habitat for animals. At the landscape scale, they represent hydro-refugia favoring increased connectivity among animals and allowing migrations during dry periods. We conclude that in the East African Rift where low, highly seasonal rainfall and high evaporative demand limit vegetation growth in many areas, groundwater-fed zones create diverse microhabitats and play a major role in ecosystem functioning. It is likely that, within a context of increasing aridity and expansion of grass-dominated open habitats during the Mio-Pliocene, early hominins and many other animals viewed edaphically sustained woodlands as attractive habitats. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arráiz, H.; Ashley, G.M.; Barboni, D.; Bourel, B.; Mazur, J.-C.","","266",2019,"Ardipithecus; Groundwater; Hominin; Hydro-refugia; Paleoenvironment; Pliocene","","","","","","","","",""

Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating provides a new chronology of the sand sheet that relates as well to the formation, preservation, and visibility of the local archaeological record. The lower sand (unit Q2) (44.8 ± 2.9 ka) and the upper sand (unit Q3) (22.2 ± 1.6-5.2 ± 0.3 ka) have a combined thickness of less than 2 m. The Q2 sand is characterized by a red Bt paleosol, and the Q3 sand has a weak calcic paleosol with stage I carbonate morphology. Elevated amounts of airborne silt were incorporated in the Q3 sand during the period 24-14.5 ka, representing higher amounts of dust in the atmosphere during glacial and lateglacial time. Multiple OSL ages from the Q3 sand indicate a slow net sedimentation rate of 0.06-0.09 mm/yr, similar to other OSL-dated sand sheets in the region; sand deposits in dune fields have higher accumulation rates. The McGregor A horizon soil, radiocarbon-dated to younger than 0.5 ka, occurs at the top of the sand sheet and likely formed with desert grassland vegetation. Thousands of recent mesquite coppice dunes (unit Q4d) mantle the sand sheet, and two are dated to the twentieth century by OSL and 137Cs. Archaeological sites that postdate 3000 B.C. are concentrated, sometimes together, on the surface of the sand sheet, while sites that predate 3000 B.C., although rare, may be buried within the Q3 eolian sand. The Q2 sand is too old to contain archaeological sites, although site features may intrude into the sand. Previous chronologies of the sand sheet are based on radiocarbon dates of charcoal from archaeo logical sites, on radiocarbon dates of soil carbonate, and on soil-geomorphology correlations with Rio Grande Valley alluvium.

Much of the literature and management concerning openlands emphasizes burning to control woody growth, based on the interpretation that these habitats and their species assemblages were widespread during the pre-European period as a consequence of natural disturbance and Native American land use. By focusing on the coastal region of New England-New York, which harbors excellent examples of these habitats, is characterized by many natural disturbances (e.g. hurricanes, fire, salt spray), and supported relatively dense Native American populations, we assess the paleoecological, archaeological, historical, and modern ecological evidence supporting this perspective. We conclude that: (1) pre-European uplands, including coastal areas, were predominantly forested and that openland habitats were uncommon because natural and human disturbance was infrequent and local; (2) extensive openland vegetation developed only with widespread European forest clearance and land use; (3) assemblages occupying grasslands, shrublands, and heathlands apparently have no lengthy history and are comprised of species that combined opportunistically over recent centuries; (4) the decline of grasslands, heathlands, and shrublands is a century-old phenomena related to a decline in agricultural land use, especially grazing, mowing, plowing and burning; (5) effectively all conservation areas supporting these openland assemblages experienced intensive historical land use; and (6) the modern distribution, composition, and structure of these habitats are largely determined by European land use. Recognition that openland assemblages have cultural origins does not diminish the biological, cultural, or aesthetic value of these habitats. However, it does suggest that grasslands, heathlands and shrublands may be best managed using a combination of approaches that replicate the effects of historical land use. Conservationists should recognize that most of these landscapes have cultural origins and are inherently dynamic; that some vegetation structures and communities cannot be maintained continuously on a given site; and that management is most effective when based on historical and ecological studies leading to clearly defined objectives and rigorous long-term measurement and re-evaluation. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Foster, D.R.; Motzkin, G.","","185",2003,"Coastal landscape; Cultural landscape; Disturbance; Early successional forest; Fire; Grasslands; Heathlands; Land use; New England; Shrublands","","","","","","","","",""

These data show that the estuary complex has had a history of rapid and dramatic change in response to (1) sea-level rise across the irregular topography of the ancestral Trinity River valley and (2) changes in climate, which regulated sediment supply to the estuary. In general, the valley morphology consists of a deep incision near the center and broad, terraced flanks. As sea level rose during the Holocene and flooded the valley, the shape of the estuary changed from narrow and deep to wide and rounded. As sea level rose to the elevation of the relatively flat fluvial terraces, these areas were flooded rapidly, resulting in expansions in bay area and dramatic reorganization of bay environments. The most notable changes were up-valley shifts in the bayhead delta of tens of kilometers in a few centuries. Radiocarbon ages indicate that these events took place ca. 9600, ca. 8500, and between ca. 7700 and 7400 yr B.P. The early flooding events occurred when sea level was rising rapidly (average 4.2 mm/yr; Milliken et al., this volume, Chapter 1), perhaps episodically. The ca. 8200 yr B.P. flooding surface corresponds to a prominent terrace at -14 m. The ca. 7700-7400 yr B.P. flooding episode was the most dramatic in terms of its impact on the estuary setting. Following this event, the area of the estuary increased by ̃30%. This flooding event occurred as the rate of sea-level rise was starting to decrease. The level of this flooding surface also corresponds to a terrace at ̃-10 m, but the magnitude of flooding is too large to be explained entirely by flooding of this terrace. At the same time, Matagorda Bay to the west and Sabine Lake to the east experienced similar dramatic flooding events. This event occurred when the climate of east-central Texas was in transition from cool and moist to warm and dry, and the vegetation cover of the region was undergoing a reduction in forest and an increase in grasslands. Hence, the ca. 7700-7400 event was likely amplified by a reduction in sediment supply to the estuary triggered by this regional climatic change coupled with an increase in sediment accommodation space caused by flooding of a terrace. Following the ca. 7700-7400 yr B.P. flooding event, the estuary setting changed relatively little as the rate of sea-level rise decreased to less than 2.0 mm/yr. By ca. 2600 cal yr B.P., the modern Trinity bayhead delta had begun to form. Circa 1600 cal yr B.P., the delta experienced a phase of rapid growth. This more recent episode of delta growth may have resulted from an increase in the rate of sediment supply, perhaps associated with human occupation and agriculture in the drainage basin. More recent anthropogenic changes include accelerated subsidence due to groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction. These changes are occurring at rates that approach those that occurred during prior flooding events of the Holocene. Thus, the Galveston estuary complex could be on the verge of another flooding event that would mainly impact the Trinity bayhead delta and low-lying areas around the delta. © 2008 The Geological Society of America.","Anderson, J.B.; Milliken, K.T.; Rodriguez, A.B.; Taviani, M.","","443",2008,"Climate change; Estuary; Flooding; Sea-level rise","","","","","","","","",""

There was an insufficient range in ungulate damage to consider differences caused by grazing. Flooding with return intervals exceeding 50 years caused major change on approximately 25% of the surveyed streams regardless of initial stream type. One-quarter of the changed streams continued to experience cross-sectional change during a six- to eight-year period of low-to-normal flows. On these streams, upper banks either receded to expose a new, lower floodplain or flattened to a less vertical slope. On streams that did not change type, flooding substantially reduced pool area, which did not recover during the succeeding period, presumably because energy was insufficient to form pools. High flows flushed fine sediment from the streams that did not change type, but fines returned in six years of low flows.

In Chesson’s framework, pathogens contribute to stabilizing mechanisms when they intensify negative intraspecific interactions, such as density-dependent disease. Additionally, pathogens contribute to equalizing mechanisms when they reduce differences in performance among species. Life-history trade-offs predict higher susceptibility to pathogens in rapidly growing species, which could equalize performance among fast- and slow-growing species in the presence of pathogens. In a coastal prairie in California, we studied the impact of leaf diseases on the performance of 17 co-occurring species of Trifolium and Medicago (“clovers”). We transplanted clovers in randomized arrays into the natural prairie community in 3 years of common garden experiments. We quantified infection rates by isolating fungi from leaves, and we measured disease severity as per cent leaf area damaged. In a fungicide experiment, we measured the impact of infection on biomass and survival. We assessed whether disease on transplants was positively related to natural abundance of that species in the surrounding community, which we monitored over 5 years. We assessed life-history trade-offs by testing whether more rapidly growing species were more susceptible to pathogens. Rank abundance of clover species was stable over 5 years despite marked environmental fluctuations. Across hosts, fungal infection was not linearly related to density, although transplants of species that were locally absent showed lower and more variable infection. Disease severity was greater for more abundant species, but in only 1 of 3 years, and response to fungicide was not stronger in more abundant species. As predicted by life-history trade-offs, faster-growing species experienced greater fungal infection. However, the impact of that infection was less negative, not more negative, on faster-growing species. Our results suggest that life-history trade-offs in plant–pathogen interactions may influence equalizing mechanisms among species in this guild, but the combined effects of greater infection with greater tolerance may limit rather than promote coexistence. We also found modest evidence that density-dependent disease may contribute to stabilizing mechanisms. Lack of host specificity, rapid evolution of host use and temporal variation in climatic conditions may all influence the role that pathogens play in coexistence of these closely related plants. © 2018 The Authors.

Fossil pollen, spores, seeds, leaves, and mollusks of a core from Pickerel Lake were analyzed in order to work out the limnological history of the lake and the vegetational history of the nearby upland. The data were then compared with ecological data from modern vegetation and the lake. The following chronology was deduced from these studies: (1) Prior to 10,670 years ago, boreal forest existed around Pickerel Lake and on the nearby upland, the climate was cool and moist, there were a few marshes around the lake margin, and the lake was less than 3 m deep at the coring site. The lake water was alkaline but not very hard. (2) Between 10,670 and about 8000 years ago, there were mixed deciduous trees around the lake, in gullies, and on the upland; however, tree cover on the upland was less dense and had numerous prairie-like openings with grass and perhaps bracken fern. The climate was warmer than that of the previous age. The lake was probably deeper at the study site, and was probably slightly harder. (3) From about 8000 to 4000 years ago, blue-stem prairie dominated the upland. Deciduous forest was almost absent, except perhaps for a few groves around the lake or in gullies. The climate was characterized by recurring summer drought, and the level of Pickerel Lake consequently fluctuated markedly. The depth of the lake at the coring site was less than 3 m, and the water was hard with high carbonate content. Reed marshes were common around the lake margin, and during low water levels a rich herbaceous vegetation invaded the exposed lake sediments. (4) Since about 4000 years ago, the upland and lake vegetation has been about the same as now, with prairie dominating the upland and with an abundant oak and ash deciduous forest common around lakes and in gullies. Summer droughts were not so common as during the preceding period. The lake was less than 3 m deep at the study site.

The fossil soils can be recognized from irregular vertical tubular structures (fossil root traces and burrows), massive bioturbated layers with gradational contacts (soil horizons), complex cracking and veining (peds and cutans), and distinctive petrographic textures (sepic plasmic fabrics). Other features of these deposits, such as patterns of fossil bone accumulation, horizons of calcareous nodules and local variations in mineralogy, and trace and major chemical elements, are also evidence for fossil soils. The few late diagenetic alterations (those after burial of the soils) found in Badlands National Park have not obscured the abudnant early diagenetic alterations (those of ancient soil formation). Ten different kinds of fossil soils recognized in the Pinnacles area of Badlands National Park have been classified into paleosol series, which are standard mapping units used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Each series represents a particular ancient environment and is evidence of past soil-forming factors, such as climate, organisms, topographic relief, parent material, and time of formation. Fossil soils of the Pinnacles area are evidence for progressively drier climate, from humid during Late Eocene time to semiarid during Late Oligocene time. There was also a concomitant change in vegetation from Late Eocene forest, to Early Oligocene open woodland, to early Late Oligocene savanna with stream-side gallery woodland to mid-Late Oligocene savanna, and finally to latest Late Oligocene open grassland with scattered stream-side trees. Late Eocene mammalian faunas of forests and woodlands were supplanted by an invasion from elsewhere of savanna-adapted mammals, which persisted in recognizable evolutionary lineages throughout Oligocene time. Topographic relief was generally low and uniform, but for periods of marked stream incision during Late Eocene time, at about the Eocene-Oligocene boundary and during the late part of Late Oligocene time. Parent materials of most of the paleosols (except for those on the basal unconformity with Late Cretaceous marine rocks) consisted of volcanic ash fall, re-sorted soil material, and fartransported alluvium. Re-sorted soil material was most common in sediments of the stable wooded landscape during Early Oligocene time, but volcanic ash became increasingly more prominent in parent materials of less developed, sparsely vegetated, arid-land soils from early to latest Late Oligocene time. Time of formation of the soils became progressively less with time, from strongly developed soils during the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene to moderately developed soils during Late Oligocene time. Maximum rates of sediment accumulation calculated from estimates of the time of formation of the paleosols are progressively higher from the Late Eocene to the Late Oligocene. Comparisons between rates for sequences of different paleosols are an indication that changing vegetation, and perhaps to a lesser extent local tectonic movements, were the main factors controlling rates of sediment accumulation.","","","193",1983,"","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we compiled archaeological, historical, palaeoecological and ecological information on Martha's Vineyard to investigate temporal and spatial variation in landscape pattern and process. Although &lt; 250 km2, this island off the Massachusetts coast embraces remarkable geographical variation and harbours uncommon plant and animal assemblages that make it a national priority for conservation. Location: The study embraces the entire island of Martha's Vineyard, which lies c. 8 km south of Cape Cod and the mainland of Massachusetts. The triangular-shaped island contains three major geomorphological regions: moraine forms a series of irregular and subparallel ridges and hills 40 to over 80 m in elevation that terminate at the western end of the island in high cliffs at Gay Head and Squibnocket; sandy glacial outwash overlying moraine spreads down the northeastern end of the island forming a region of low undulating hills and shallow depressions 15-30 m in elevation, and an extensive outwash plain stretches across the central and eastern part of the island and slopes gently from 30-m elevation in the north to &lt; 3 m towards the southern coast where it is dissected by a series of north-south trending valleys that terminate in coastal ponds. In all areas except the southwest corner the island is underlain by &gt;100 m of Quaternary and coastal plain sediments. Methods: Long-term records of vegetation, fire, natural disturbance and human activity were compiled over the past 2000 years and across the physiographic variation on the island. Palaeoecological interpretations of vegetation, fire, climate and land-use history are based on a series of eleven stratigraphies from ponds, lakes and wetlands; archaeological data were compiled from recent surveys; historical data were assembled from census and town records, fire records, aerial photographs and cartographic series; and ecological information was derived from forestry and conservation surveys and field sampling of vegetation, soils and site characteristics. Extensive use was made of geographical information systems and multivariate statistical analyses. Results: Spatial patterns in vegetation over the past 2000 years have varied strongly with soils and physiography, which are also associated with major differences in fire and land-use history. Mesic hardwood forests that seldom burned occupy the western moraine, open oak-pine and hardwood forests occur on the frequently burned and dissected outwash plain along the south coast, and pine-oak forests cover the central outwash plain, which extends across much of the island and displays among the highest charcoal values in New England. Although a relatively large Native American population may have been an important source of fire ignitions there is no palynological or archaeological evidence that this culture cleared substantial areas or directly altered the extent of forest cover. Shifts in forest composition and fire were associated with regional climate change during the pre-European period, whereas pronounced changes in forest cover and the development of extensive open-land areas of grassland, shrubland and heathland were driven by European land use. The contrasting characteristics, land-use histories and ownerships of different regions of the island yield contrasting conservation priorities and management directions. The mesic morainal forests have changed modestly in composition during the historical period and can effectively support a distinct woodland flora if adequately protected. The large outwash plain is broken by non-native plantations but could yield an effective landscape mosaic of oak and pine forests interrupted by extensive scrub oak barrens that could be maintained through prescribed fire or cutting. In contrast, the south shore grasslands and shrublands are the product of intensive agricultural land use. These habitats and their unusual suite of plants and animals require traditional land-use practices, or their substitutes, in order to reverse the ongoing increase in woody species and to maintain these cultural landscapes. Main Conclusion: The biotic, edaphic, disturbance and historical diversity across this relatively small landscape is remarkable and yet poses many challenges to interpretation and conservation. The modern landscape can only be understood through knowledge of its long-term past and can be best managed in the context of the natural and cultural factors that have shaped it through time.","Barry, S.; Clayden, S.; Foster, D.R.; Hall, B.; Parshall, T.","","29",2002,"Conservation; Cultural landscape; Fire; Grassland; Land-use history; Natural disturbance; New England; Oak; Pine","","","","","","","","",""

They are linked to regeneration strategies of plant communities in ecosystems prone to disturbances.1 Bud bank research is fast moving up the research agenda as an approach to better understand the dynamics and resilience of ecosystems.2 Regeneration from seed is only one of a myriad of strategies that plants use to survive and flourish in ecosystems with seasonal rainfall, above-ground consumers such as fire and herbivores, or recurrent droughts. Because the vegetation dynamics, structure and function of southern African grassy biomes are driven by these disturbances, one would expect interesting below-ground regeneration strategies. However, studies on below-ground traits are underrepresented in the scientific literature, with only a few contributions pertaining to ‘below-ground bud bank’ as the main topic. Furthermore, most of these studies have been conducted in the northern hemisphere, such as in China, central Europe and the USA.3 Bud bank related research in the southern hemisphere is represented by one study from South American grasslands4 and one from savannas in Botswana3. Recent papers on ‘underground trees of Africa’5 and the underground storage organs characteristic of ‘old-growth grasslands’6 have highlighted the importance of quantifying and describing below-ground regeneration strategies to understand the evolution of our ecosystems, and appropriate ways to manage and conserve them. The savanna and grassland biomes in southern Africa host a high richness of herbaceous plants, particularly forbs, which are often more abundant below ground than in the standing vegetation.7 Below-ground bud banks comprise an important regeneration strategy for many savanna species, and yet very little is known about below-ground strategies for plant growth-form coexistence in grassy ecosystems. Considering the importance of understanding the ‘below-ground world’ for a broader comprehension of savanna ecosystem resilience in general, savanna ecologists from southern Africa and Brazil discussed the need to bring local researchers up to date with the latest approaches in regeneration strategies. In May 2019, a first hands-on workshop on how to survey bud banks and below-ground plant organs in grassy ecosystems was hosted by the Forb Ecology Research Group from the Unit for Environmental Sciences and Management, North-West University (Potchefstroom, South Africa), in collaboration with São Paulo State University (UNESP) in Brazil. This 2-day event attracted several established researchers in southern Africa and a robust community of young scientists and postgraduate students representing North-West University, University of Pretoria, University of the Witwatersrand and University of Edinburgh (Scotland). Considering the novelty of the subject and the underrepresentation of similar studies on grassy biomes in southern Africa, the workshop aimed to bring this approach to the ecological research community, broadening the understanding of the dynamics of southern African grassy biomes for improved management and conservation of these highly diverse ecosystems. The 2-day workshop covered relevant background information on bud bank related ecological research, after which delegates had the opportunity to undertake field surveying at the Unit for Environmental Sciences and Management research facility outside Potchefstroom, followed by working group sessions to analyse and interpret results. The theoretical background of the workshop highlighted the critical role of the below-ground structures in regeneration after disturbances, and the importance of a standardised approach to investigate the morphology and terminology of below-ground bud-bearing organs. Based on the available literature on the morphology and terminology of belowground bud organs1,2, the workshop emphasised the importance of these less explored functional traits for future studies in grassland and savanna ecology. The event furthermore provided opportunities among scientists interested in grassy ecosystems to network and discuss projects and questions related to grassland and savanna dynamics and conservation. Young scientists had the opportunity to partake in such discussions to stimulate their thinking on the links between diversity, function, evolutionary history and disturbance in grassy biomes of South Africa. © 2019.

These prehistoric shorelines now stand as relict 'islands' surrounded by coastal marsh. Although the chenier woodlands were once extensive, most have now been converted to rangeland, roads and homesites, and therefore presently exist as remnants. The woody species in six remnant sites were sampled in order to determine species diversity and importance. High numbers of the introduced species, Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb., resulted in species diversity in the two Little Chenier sites being significantly lower than those on Grand Chenier, Tiger Island and Pecan Island. This appears to be due to a higher level of habitat destruction in the Little Chenier than in the other cheniers. Importance values suggest a high degree of heterogeneity among the sites chosen for study. For example, Quercus virginians L. Celtis laevigata Wilid., Cephalanthus occidentalis L. and Sapium were each the most important species in at least one of the sampled sites. An ordination of the six sites suggests that only three sites form an ecologically meaningful cluster and the remaining three sites are clearly segregated from all others. The ordination pattern may be due primarily to varying levels of habitat destruction as a result of historic anthropogenic activity.","Meyer, H.A.; Neyland, R.","","124",1997,"Chinese Tallow; Sapium sebiferum; Woodland remnants","","","","","","","","",""

This paper evaluates how agricultural land use influenced the relative responsiveness of floods, erosion, and sedimentation to extreme and nonextreme hydrologic activity occurring in watersheds of the Upper Mississippi Valley. Temporally overlapping stratigraphic and historical instrumental records from southwestern Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois show how agricultural modification of a natural prairie and forest land cover affected the behavior of floods and sedimentation during the last two centuries. For comparison, pre-agriculture Holocene alluvial sediments document the sensitivity of floods and alluvial activity to climate change prior to significant human influences on the natural land cover. High-resolution floodplain stratigraphy of the last two centuries shows that accelerated runoff associated with agricultural land use has increased the magnitudes of floods across a wide range of recurrence frequencies. The stratigraphic record also shows that large floods have been particularly important to the movement and storage of sediment in the floodplains of the Upper Mississippi Valley. Comparison of floodplain alluvial sequences in watersheds ranging in scale from headwater tributaries to the main valley Mississippi River demonstrates that land use changes triggered hydrologic responses that were transmitted nearly simultaneously to all watershed scales. In turn, flood-driven hydraulic adjustments in channel and floodplain morphologies contributed to feedback effects that caused scale-dependent long-term lag responses. There has been a general reduction in magnitudes of flooding, erosion, and sedimentation since the mid-20th century, largely in response to better land conservation practices. The reduction trend is most apparent on tributary watersheds of a few hundred square kilometers and smaller sizes. However, the main-channel Upper Mississippi River, with associated drainage areas between about 100,000-200,000 km2, has experienced increased occurrences of large floods during the second half of the 20th century. Most of these large floods have been associated with snowmelt runoff which is occurring more rapidly and earlier in the season in response to a trend toward warmer winters and springs in the late 20th century. Modification of the natural drainage network through establishment of drainage tiles and channelization has also continued during the late 20th century. Tiling and channelization have increased drainage efficiency and probably have contributed in part to the occurrence of large floods on the Mississippi River, but the magnitudes of their effects are unknown at present. In spite of reduced sediment loads since about 1950 on all watershed scales, the anomalous high frequency of large floods on the Upper Mississippi River continues the accelerated delivery of agriculturally-related sediment to floodplain and backwater environments. The results of this study indicate that agricultural land use has escalated landscape sensitivity to such a degree that modern process rates provide a very distorted representation of process rates that occurred in the geologic past prior to human disturbance. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Knox, J.C.","","42",2001,"Agriculture; Floodplains; Holocene; Soil erosion","","","","","","","","",""

The entire postglacial (Holocene) sediment record in the deepest part of Elk Lake is composed of annual layers (varves) that record the seasonal pulses of many sediment components, and, most important, provide high-resolution (seasonal) time calibration of rates and timing of environmental change. These varved sediments contain many allochthonous and autochthonous components that are sensitive to changing environmental conditions in the drainage basin and the lake. The mineral components of Elk Lake sediments consist mainly of authigenic calcium, magnesium, and manganese carbonate minerals (low-Mg calcite, high-Mg calcite, dolomite, and rhodochrosite), opaline silica (from diatoms), X-ray amorphous iron and manganese oxyhydroxides, and an iron phosphate mineral tentatively identified as rockbridgeite [(Fe, Mn)Fe4(P04)3(0H)5], plus minor contributions from fine-grained detrital quartz, feldspar, illite, and kaolinite. The most notable characteristic of the sediments in Elk Lake is that most of the components were formed in the lake. Q-mode factor analysis of sediment geochemistry reduced 23 observed compositional variables, expressed as percent or parts per million of elements, to three composite variables (factor loadings) whose ""concentrations"" are expressed on a scale of -1.0 to 1.0. Factor 1 expresses the composition of the inorganic clastic fraction based on concentrations of Mg, Na, Al, Cr, V, Y, Sc, Ni, Sr, Co, and Cu. Factor 2 expresses the similarities in variations of Fe, Mn, P, organic carbon, and Mo. Factor 3 loadings are a synthesis of concentrations of Mn, S, Ca, La, and Ba. Geochemical characteristics define three distinct chemical stages in the development of Elk lake: (1) a carbonate-, manganese-, iron-, sulfur-rich early-lake stage that lasted from 10,400 to 8200 varve yr; (2) a clastic- and diatom-rich mid-Holocene prairielake stage that lasted from 8200 to 4000 varve yr; and (3) a final iron-, manganese-, phosphate-, and organic-rich modern-lake stage that developed over the past 4000 yr. The chemical characteristics of the sediments deposited during these three lake phases can be represented by the average compositions of three groups of samples: (1) the average composition of sediments deposited over the past 2000 yr, representing the modern-lake stage; (2) the composition of a 50 varve sample centered on 5700 varve yr that represents the maximum clastic influx into the lake during the prairie period; and (3) the average composition of sediments deposited over the initial 2000 yr of the lake's existence (10,400 to 8400 varve yr).","Dean, W.E.","","276",1993,"","","","","","","","","",""

The potential impact of these processes has not been thoroughly investigated as groundwater solutes are mostly thought to be sourced from chemical reactions with soil and bedrock, although dust is often viewed as an important delivery mechanism of nutrients to other ecosystems, including those in mountain and tropical settings. We present results of computer and hand-calculated (manual) inverse modeling of two years of stream-water chemistry, spanning a dry and a wet year, for a groundwater-fed headwater stream at the Konza Tallgrass Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research Site in northeastern Kansas. Weathering of the limestone and shale bedrock at the site provide a possible source of solutes to the groundwater-fed stream, but our modeling suggests an alternate source considering the pathway of groundwater recharge likely encounters highly reactive phases before encountering bedrock. We used the mineralogy and geochemistry of local dust collected previously, estimates of a possible chemical composition of phytolith containing potassium, and an impure calcite representing measured limestone bedrock chemistry to show that chemical reactions with the current dust flux are adequate to account for the groundwater chemistry. Average annual amounts were about: 1) 380 kg ha−1 yr−1 dust dissolved, 2) 80 kg ha−1 yr−1 bedrock carbonate dissolved, and 3) 320 kg ha−1 yr−1 phytoliths precipitated. Small amounts of cation exchange were also required to balance the models. There were only small differences between the computer and manual inverse models; both methods resulted in up to 4.6 times more mass of dust dissolved than bedrock. We suggest that dust weathering may be a process that occurs widely, considering the ubiquitous dust flux in continental regions. Significance of research: Solutes in groundwater and in streams fed by groundwater are thought to be mostly derived from aquifer bedrock and soil water recharging the aquifer. This paradigm may fail for landscapes that have been subaerially exposed for 10's to 100's of millions of years in terrains where relatively rapid dissolution of minerals dominates, such as carbonate-mineral dominated rocks like limestone. Here we test whether dust, having high surface area and being the first inorganic solid encountered by meteoric precipitation, could provide enough solutes water to reduce the amount of bedrock that dissolves, extending the timeframe of landscape evolution. We found, through inverse modeling with PHREEQC, that dust can provide 4.6 times as much mass to stream water in merokarst than calcite and that the mass of dust dissolved was the same order of magnitude as local dust deposition. These results give permissive evidence that dust is important to understanding groundwater chemistry. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Macpherson, G.L.; Sullivan, P.L.","","527",2019,"Chemical weathering; Critical zone; Dust; Dust deposition; Headwater stream; Inverse model; Karst; Merokarst","","","","","","","","",""

The vegetation above the caves studied is either savannah (two caves, above which vegetation has been minimally disturbed) or discrete patches of grassland and woodland (two caves, above which vegetation has been highly disturbed). We tested two hypotheses concerning CO 2 in the cave atmospheres: (1) cave ventilation by tropospheric air is the primary sink for CO 2 and (2) CO 2 is primarily derived from the deepest rooting plants growing above the caves. Within caves, we monitored CO 2 at individual locations on monthly and daily time-scales and measured CO 2 along transects with increasing distance from the cave entrances. We also measured CO 2 in the pore spaces of soils under grasses and trees above each of the caves. We calculated δ 13C values of respired CO 2 (δ 13C r) for all gas samples using measured δ 13C values and CO 2 concentrations. We then identified the sources of cave CO 2 by comparing cave-air and soil CO 2 δ 13C r values. At all locations in each Texas cave, CO 2 concentrations were highest (lowest) and δ 13C values were lowest (highest) during the summer (winter). Cave-air CO 2 concentrations consistently increased and δ 13C values consistently decreased with distance from the cave entrances. Similar but smaller magnitude seasonal variations in CO 2 concentrations occurred in the Arizona cave and no seasonal or spatial variation in the δ 13C of cave-air CO 2 was observed. The mean δ 13C r values of CO 2 in soils under grass were 3.5-4.5‰ higher than the δ 13C r values of CO 2 in soils under trees. In the caves under savannah, mean δ 13C r values of cave-air CO 2 (-24‰ in both caves) were within 1‰ of the mean δ 13C r values of CO 2 in soils under trees. In caves covered by large, contiguous areas of grassland, the δ 13C r values of cave-air CO 2 were similar to grassland soil values during the summer and were intermediate between grassland and woodland soil values during the winter. The observed spatial and temporal variations in cave-air CO 2 are consistent with density-driven ventilation controlled by seasonal surface temperature changes as the primary sink for CO 2 in the Texas caves. The consistent agreement between soil and cave δ 13C r values indicate that the same mixing and diffusion equations that are used to calculate δ 13C r values of soil CO 2 also apply to cave-air CO 2. Our results suggest that the majority of CO 2 advects or diffuses into these caves from soils as a gas rather than being transported in aqueous solution. Measured δ 13C r values and numerical production-diffusion modeling supports our hypothesis that the majority of gaseous CO 2 in these caves is derived from deeply rooted vegetation. The carbon isotope composition of groundwater and speleothem calcite used for paleoclimate records are therefore likely biased toward deeply rooted plants, even if sparsely present. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Ball, C.E.; Banner, J.L.; Breecker, D.O.; Cowan, B.D.; Meyer, K.W.; Payne, A.E.; Quade, J.","","96",2012,"","","","","","","","","",""

Habitat structure contributes to thermal heterogeneity at a variety of spatial scales, but quantifying microclimates at organism-relevant resolutions remains a challenge. Landscapes that appear homogeneous at large scales may offer patchily distributed thermal refuges at finer scales. We quantified the relationship between vegetation structure and the thermal environment at a scale relevant to small, terrestrial animals using a new approach for mapping fine-scale thermal heterogeneity. We expected that vegetation would create attenuated microclimates and that the influence of vegetation structure would vary seasonally. We measured shrub volume, horizontal cover and operative temperature (Te) in a sagebrush-steppe habitat in Idaho, USA, at 534 microsites across two study sites of c. 1 km2 each. We modelled relationships between habitat structure and both mean daily maximum temperature ((Formula presented.)) and mean diurnal temperature range ((Formula presented.)) for each study site during summer and winter. Aerial imagery from unmanned aerial systems was used to estimate shrub volume and canopy cover at 1-m resolution, and we applied the best fit model to map thermal heterogeneity across broader extents. Increasing shrub volume and cover was associated with lower (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.), but strengths of the relationships differed between study sites. There was considerable heterogeneity in availability of thermal refuges across sagebrush-steppe rangelands that have traditionally been considered relatively homogeneous. This technique can help ecologists and land managers identify critical thermal refuges that large-scale climate modelling can overlook and thus contribute to an understanding of animal–habitat relationships under changing climates and land uses. © 2018 The Authors.

The plant communities so reconstructed contained more forbs and/or shrubs than present-day communities and were dominated by cool-season rather than warm-season grasses. Although these differences could be due to climate change, the pattern of change from cool-season to warm-season grasses is not consistent with the accepted pattern of climate change. Grazing pressure could account for this change in plant community composition. Livestock tend to graze Capitol Reef in the cool season, and the area is rested from grazing during the warm season. This pattern could account for the decline in cool-season grasses. Phytolith analyses can serve as an alternative method for assessing the impact of management on grasslands.

Halfway Creek Marsh, at the junction of Halfway Creek and the Mississippi River on Wisconsin's western border, is representative of such historical transformation. This marsh became the focus of a 2005-2006 investigation by scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of Wisconsin- Madison, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, who used an understanding of the historical transformation to help managers identify possible restoration alternatives for Halfway Creek Marsh. Field-scale topographic surveys and sediment cores provided data for reconstructing patterns and rates of historical overbank sedimentation in the marsh. Information culled from historical maps, aerial photographs, General Land Offi ce Survey notes, and other historical documents helped establish the timing of anthropogenic disturbances and document changes in channel patterns. Major human disturbances, in addition to agricultural land uses, included railroad and road building, construction of artifi cial levees, drainage alterations, and repeated dam failures associated with large floods. A volume of approximately 1,400,000 m 3 , involving up to 2 m of sandy historical overbank deposition, is stored through the upper and lower marshes and along the adjacent margins of Halfway Creek and its principal tributary, Sand Lake Coulee. The estimated overbank sedimentation rate for the entire marsh is ̃3,000 m 3 yr- 1 for the recent period 1994-2006. In spite of reduced surface runoff and soil erosion in recent years, this recent sedimentation rate still exceeds by ̃4 times the early settlement (1846-1885) rate of 700 m 3 yr- 1 , when anthropogenic acceleration of upland surface runoff and soil erosion was beginning. The highest rate of historical bottomland sedimentation occurred from 1919 to 1936, when the estimated overbank sedimentation rate was 20,400 m 3 yr- 1 . This rate exceeded by nearly 30 times the 1846-1886 rate. Artifi cial levees were constructed along the upper reach of Halfway Creek in the marsh during the early twentieth century to restrict fl ooding on the adjacent bottomlands. Anomalously high overbank sedimentation rates subsequently occurred on the fl oodplain between the levees, which also facilitated more effi cient transport of sediment into the lower marsh bottomland. Although overbank sedimentation rates dropped after 1936, corresponding to the widespread adoption of soil-conservation and agricultural best-management practices, the continuation of anomalously high overbank sedimentation between the levees led to increased bank heights and development of a relatively deep channel. The deep cross-section morphology is commonly mistaken as evidence of channel incision; however, this morphology actually resulted from excessive overbank sedimentation. The historical metamorphosis of the Halfway Creek channel and riparian wetlands underscores the importance of understanding the long-term history of channel and fl oodplain evolution when restoration of channels and riparian wetlands are under consideration. Sedimentation patterns and channel morphology for Halfway Creek Marsh probably are representative of other anthropogenically altered riparian wetlands in the Upper Mississippi River System and similar landscapes elsewhere.","Fitzpatrick, F.A.; Knox, J.C.; Schubauer-Berigan, J.P.","","451",2009,"","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly true in Mediterranean climate ecosystems where the warmest temperatures and greatest moisture availability are seasonally asynchronous. We examined plant phenological responses at both the population and community levels to four climate treatments (control, warming, drought, and warming plus additional precipitation) embedded within three prairies across a 520 km latitudinal Mediterranean climate gradient within the Pacific Northwest, USA. At the population level, we monitored flowering and abundances in spring 2017 of eight range-restricted focal species planted both within and north of their current ranges. At the community level, we used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured from fall 2016 to summer 2018 to estimate peak live biomass, senescence, seasonal patterns, and growing season length. We found that warming exerted a stronger control than our moisture manipulations on phenology at both the population and community levels. Warming advanced flowering regardless of whether a species was within or beyond its current range. Importantly, many of our focal species had low abundances, particularly in the south, suggesting that establishment, in addition to phenological shifts, may be a strong constraint on their future viability. At the community level, warming advanced the date of peak biomass regardless of site or year. The date of senescence advanced regardless of year for the southern and central sites but only in 2018 for the northern site. Growing season length contracted due to warming at the southern and central sites (~3 weeks) but was unaffected at the northern site.

The latter potentially represent a grazing-induced, degraded ecosystem state, but could also arise via mechanisms related to feedbacks between vegetation cover and soil moisture availability that are unrelated to grazing. The degree to which grazing contributes to the formation or maintenance of degraded patches has been widely discussed and modeled, but empirical studies of the role of grazing in their formation, persistence, and reversibility are limited. We report on a long-term (17 years) grazing removal experiment in a semi-arid savanna where vegetated patches composed of perennial grasses were interspersed within large (&gt;10 m2) patches of bare soil. Short-term (3 years) grazing removal did not allow bare patches to become revegetated, whereas following long-term (17 years) grazing removal, bare soil patches were revegetated by a combination of stoloniferous grasses and tufted bunchgrasses. In the presence of grazers, stoloniferous grasses partially recolonized bare patches, but this did not lead to full recovery or to the establishment of tufted bunchgrasses. These results show that grazers alter both the balance between bare and vegetated patches, as well as the types of grasses dominating both patch types in this semiarid savanna. Synthesis: Large herbivores fundamentally shaped the composition and spatial pattern of the herbaceous layer by maintaining a two-phase herbaceous mosaic. However, bare patches within this mosaic can recover given herbivore removal over sufficiently long time scales, and hence do not represent a permanently degraded ecosystem state. © 2019 The Authors.

The first episode is dominated by the direct and indirect effects of Late Wisconsin glacial ice in the basin headwaters. This period, which lasted until about 14000 years B.P., was generally a time of progressive valley aggradation by a braided river system transporting large quantities of bedload sediment. An island braided system evolved during the second episode, which extended from about 14 000 to 9000 years B.P. The second episode is associated with major environmental changes of deglaciation when occurrences of major floods and sustained flows of low sediment concentration from drainage of proglacial lakes produced major downcutting. By the time of the beginning of the third episode about 9000 years B.P., most vegetation communities had established their approximate average Holocene locations. The change of climate and establishment of good vegetation cover caused upland landscapes of the UMV to become relatively stable during the Holocene in comparison to their relative instability during the Late Wisconsin. However, Holocene remobilization of Late Wisconsin age sediment stored in tributary valleys resulted in a return to long-term upper Mississippi River aggradation. The dominance of Holocene deposition over transportation reflects the abundance of sandy bedload sediment introduced from tributaries and the situation that energy conditions for floods and the hydraulic gradient of the upper Mississippi River are much less for the Holocene than they were for the Late Wisconsin and deglaciation periods. Outburst floods from glacial lakes appear to have been common in the UMV during the Late Wisconsin and especially during deglaciation. Magnitudes for the Late Wisconsin floods are generally poorly understood, but an estimate of 10 000-15 000 m3 s-1 was determined for one of the largest events in the northern UMV based on heights of paleo-foreset beds in a flood unit deposited in the Savanna Terrace. For comparison, the great flood of 1993 on the upper Mississippi River was about 12 000 m3 s-1 at Keokuk, Iowa, near the Des Moines River confluence where it represented the 500-year event in relation to modern flood series. Exceptionally large outburst floods derived from the rapid drainage of pro-glacial Lake Michigan and adjacent smaller proglacial lakes between about 16 000 and 15 500 years B.P. are a likely cause of the final diversion of the Mississippi River through the Bell City-Oran Gap at the upstream end of the Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV). The largest outburst flood from northern extremities of the UMV appears to have occurred between about 11 700 and 10 800 years B.P. when the southern outlet of Lake Agassiz was incised. Based on the probable maximum capacity of the Agassiz flood channel 600 km downstream near the junction of the Wisconsin and Mississippi Rivers, the Agassiz flood discharge apparently did not exceed 30 000 m3 s-1. However, if the Agassiz flood channel here is expanded to include an incised component, then the flood discharge maximum could have been as large as 100,000 to 125 000 m3 s-1. The larger flood is presently viewed as unlikely, however, because field evidence suggests that the incised component of the cross-section probably developed after the main Agassiz flood event. Nevertheless, the large Agassiz flood between about 11 700 and 10 800 years B.P. produced major erosional downcutting and removal of Late Wisconsin sediment in the UMV. This flood also appears to be mainly responsible for the final diversion of the Mississippi River through Thebes Gap in extreme southwestern Illinois and the formation of the Charleston alluvial fan at the head of the LMV. After about 9000 years B.P. prairie-forest ecotones with associated steep seasonal climatic boundaries were established across the northern and southern regions of the UMV. The general presence of these steep climatically sensitive boundaries throughout the Holocene, in concert with the natural tendency for grasslands to be especially sensitive to climatic change, may partially explain why widespread synchroneity of Holocene alluvial episodes is recognized across the upper Mississippi River and Missouri River drainage systems. Comparison of estimated beginning ages of Holocene flood episodes and alluvial chronologies for upper Mississippi River and Missouri River systems with beginning ages for LMV meander belts and delta lobes shows a relatively strong correlation. At present, dating controls are not sufficiently adequate and confidence intervals associated with the identified ages representing system changes are too large to establish firm causal connections. Although the limitations of the existing data are numerous, the implicit causal connections suggested from existing information suggest that further exploration would be beneficial to improving the understanding of how upper valley hydrological and geomorphic events are influencing hydrological and geomorphic activity in the LMV. Since nearly 80% of the Mississippi River drainage system lies upstream of the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, there is a strong basis for supporting the idea that UMV fluvial activity should be having a strong influence on LMV fluvial activity. If this assertion is correct, then the traditional assignment of strong to dominant control by eustatic sea level variations for explaining channel avulsions, delta lobes, and meander belts in the LMV needs re-examination. A stronger role for upper valley fluvial activity as a factor influencing lower valley fluvial activity does not disregard the role of eustatic sea level, tectonic processes or other factors. Rather, upper valley fluvial episodes or specific events such as extreme floods may commonly serve as a ""triggering mechanism"" that causes a threshold of instability to be exceeded in a system that was poised for change due to sea level rise, tectonic uplift, or other environmental factors. In other situations, the upper valley fluvial activity may exert a more dominant control over many LMV fluvial processes and landforms as frequently was the case during times of glacial climatic conditions.","Knox, J.C.","","45",1996,"","","","","","","","","",""

These high altitude treeless expanses, well known to native Americans and later grazed by white settlers, are now undergoing rapid succession which threatens a unique community of plants and animals. Whatever the balds' origin and in spite of the apparent antiquity of some, much of the botanical literature insists that they are largely an artifact of relatively recent human disturbance, and, except for rare plant preservation, deserve only limited conservation effort. Such an interpretation lacks both a historical perspective and an appreciation of the possible dynamic nature of this community. The presence of both rare, endemic plants and northern relicts requiring open habitat suggests a long evolutionary history. Also, balds that are still grazed today have maintained both their biota and size. We suggest that some balds are indeed ancient and were maintained during the late Pleistocene by mammalian herbivores. Excavations at Saltville, Virginia and elsewhere reveal the presence of up to 20 species of large herbivores, including mammoth, mastodon, bison, horse, tapir, musk ox, and ground sloth until 10,000 years ago. Thereafter, the mountains supported bison, elk, and deer until European settlement. It is likely that, as in many other parts of the world, this special natural community is the result of long‐term plant‐animal interactions and thus worthy of preservation. Such preservation might best be affected by the use of wild and/or domestic herbivores. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

The comparison with the soil-water composition shows that the pedogenic carbonate is forming in equilibrium with highly evaporated soil water at the highest summer temperatures. The δ13C of the carbonate apparently reflects equilibrium with CO2 of an isotopic composition consistent with the present mixture of C3 desert shrubs and CAM cactus. Comparison with glacial-period soil carbonates shows that there has been little change in the δ18O, but that the δ13C was about 4.5%0 heavier. Independent evidence indicates that glacial-period summer temperatures were probably much cooler, and that the δ18O of precipitation was also lighter. The increase in the carbonate-water fractionation factor with decreasing temperature probably counteracted the decrease in the δ18O of precipitation, producing little net change in the δ18O of the soil carbonate. We attribute the decrease in the δ13C to replacement of a glacial-period C4 grassland by Holocene C3/CAM desert shrubs and succulents. This replacement was probably in response to an increase in temperature and reduction in summer precipitation at the end of the last glacial period. The δ13C of older soil carbonates indicates that landscape was dominated by grassland for most of the past 700 ka and that the present vegetation likely represents a relatively brief anomaly.","Campbell, A.R.; Liu, B.; Phillips, F.M.","","124",1996,"","","","","","","","","",""

Global climate change is expected to increase both the frequency and the intensity of climate extremes and there is an urgent need to understand their ecological consequences. Major challenges for advancing our understanding of the ecological consequences of climate extremes include setting a climatic baseline to facilitate the statistical determination of when climate conditions are extreme, having sufficient knowledge of ecological systems so that extreme ecological responses can be identified, and finally, being able to attribute a climate extreme as the driver of an extreme ecological response, defined as an extreme climatic event (ECE). The papers in this issue represent a cross-section of the emerging field of climate extremes research, including an examination of the palaeo-ecological record to assess patterns and drivers of extreme ecological responses in the late Quaternary, experiments in grasslands assessing a range of ecological responses and the role of ecotypic variation in determining responses to climate extremes, and the quantification of the ecological consequences of a recent ECE in the desert Southwest of the USA. Synthesis. The papers in this Special Feature suggest that although the occurrence of ECEs may be common in palaeo-ecological and observational studies, studies in which climate extremes have been experimentally imposed often do not result in ecological responses outside the bounds of normal variability of a system. Thus, ECEs occur much less frequently than their potential drivers and even less frequently than observational studies suggest. Future research is needed to identify the types and time-scales of climate extremes that result in ECEs, the potential for interactions among different types of climate changes and extremes, and the role of genetic, species and trait diversity in determining ecological responses and their evolutionary consequences. These research priorities require the development of alternative research approaches to impose realistic climate extremes on a broad range of organisms and ecosystems. © 2011 The Author.

The Cutler grasslands, consisting of about 800 ha of nearly homogeneous stands of Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.) Beauv (bluejoint reedgrass) on rolling hills, is the most extensive example of this ecosystem known in Maine. A pollen stratigraphy from an adjacent bog contained no indicators of open, grassland conditions before the land was cleared by European settlers. Deeds and historic writings are consistent with a mid-nineteenth-century origin of the grasslands by means of fire. Maine Forest Service records, forest-type maps, and aerial photographs show that the grassland-forest ecotone has barely shifted since at least 1940 in spite of a lack of extensive fires since at least 1967. Fire apparently has not been the critical factor in the maintenance of a majority of the grasslands but may have resulted in the creation of new areas of grassland. On many logged or burned sites in Alaska and western Canada, C. canadensis impedes tree regeneration by shading, by producing a thick mat of dead stems, which prevents tree seeds from reaching soil before germinating, by competition for water and nutrients, and by insulating the ground and thus delaying soil warming in the spring. The same processes probably act to perpetuate the open grasslands in Cutler. This study suggests that a low-input management plan may be most appropriate for the site.","Dieffenbacher-Krall, A.C.","","16",1996,"","","","","","","","","",""

Past lake levels provide independent evidence of environmental change over the same temporal and spatial scales as pollen analysis. We used the method established by Digerfeldt (1986, 1988) to determine the lowest past levels of three closed-basin lakes in the sandplain. The method uses a combination of evidence from macrofossils, coarse minerogenic matter, and organic matter from a transect of cores taken in the near-shore region to reconstruct past lake levels lower than present. Carbonate content, magnetic susceptibility, and pollen content in the cores provided supplementary evidence and aided cross-correlation among the cores.

The greatest lake-level lowering occurred for the lake farthest from the river that drains the sandplain; the least lake-level lowering occurred for the lakes close to the river. This spatial pattern of lake-level lowering implies that a lowering of the regional water table caused by a reduction in groundwater recharge was the ultimate cause of the lower lake levels.

Based on the presence of at least 5 species of nonvolant forest mammals on these montane islands, it is inferred that these mammals immigrated across woodlands during the Pleistocene. Because the great majority of montane forests in the American Southwest are now isolated by woodlands, post-Pleistocene immigrations may influence the structure of mammalian communities on these montane islands. This hypothesis was supported by the highly significant correlation of mammalian species richness with current isolation as well as area. When isolation was partitioned into distance to be traveled across woodland vs. grassland-chaparral habitats, species richness was significantly correlated with the latter measure of isolation but not with the former, indicating that woodlands do not represent major barriers to immigration. -from Authors","Brown, J.H.; Davis, R.; Lomolino, M.V.","","70",1989,"","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, we endeavored to determine if selected soil chemical properties of a Gilpin silt loam in West Virginia, USA, converted from an old-field to continuous maize (Zea mays, L.) silage production for 4 years, were significantly affected by tillage method (NT and plow tillage (PT)). Tillage method differences (NT &gt; PT) existed in total C, with few differences in total N, pH, NH1/+-N and NO3/--N. However, total C differences were usually restricted to the soil surface (0 to 7.5-cm layer) and small (26%) in comparison with results from other tillage method studies done under maize grain production. Soil pH decreased with increasing N-rate in the surface and 7.5- to 15-cm layers but was unrelated to tillage method. Comparison of data obtained soon after planting in Year 1 with that obtained after harvest in Year 4 suggests that total C in the NT soil had not changed over the course of the experiment. Thus, the tillage method differences found for total C were likely due to decreases brought about by the initial plowing of the PT plots. These results provide an explanation, at least in part, for the lack of a tillage method effect on silage production and soil-and fertilizer-N use, as previously reported, for this hill-land Ultisol.","Boyer, D.G.; Staley, T.E.","","42",1997,"Banded fertilizer-N; Conventional tillage; Grassland; No-tillage; Organic matter; Soil evolution","","","","","","","","",""

The term chenier is derived from the cajun term chene for oak, the tree species that colonizes the crests of the higher ridges. The Mississippi River chenier plain stretches 200 km from Sabine Pass, Texas, to Southwest Point, Louisiana and ranges between 20 and 30 km wide, with elevations of 2-6 m. The timing and the process of formation could be re-evaluated in the light of new chronostratigraphic findings in the Mississippi River delta plain. The stratigraphic relationship between the Teche and Lafourche delta complexes and Ship Shoal offshore indicates that these delta complexes belong to different delta plains that developed at different sealevels. It appears that the Teche delta complex is associated with the late Holocene delta plain which developed 7000 to 3000 yrs B.P. when sealevel stood 5-6 m lower than present. A regional transgression occurred between approximately 3000 BP and 2500 yrs B.P., leading to the transgressive submergence of the late Holocene delta plain, producing the regional Teche shoreline. The timing of this transgression conforms to the age of the most landward ridge in the chenier plain, the Little Chenier-Little Pecan Island trend, which dates at about 2500 yrs B.P. This ridge trend was originally interpreted as representing the Teche delta complex switching event with the landward Holocene/Pleistocene contact representing the high stand shoreline. The implication of this new interpretation is that the Little Chenier-Little Pecan Island trend represents the high stand shoreline, a continuation of the Teche shoreline separating the late Holocene and Recent delta plains, and that the Holocene/Pleistocene contact represents the leading edge of the marshes transgressing onto the Prairie Terrace. Significant mudflat progradation seems to require a westerly position of the Mississippi River, but the numerous different forms and ages of cheniers do not correspond well to the timing of major delta complex switching. Progradation of the chenier plain appears to be associated with building of the Recent delta plain and not the Teche complex of the late Holocene delta plain. The occurrence of individual ridges appears to be primarily tied to delta lobe switching within the Lafourche complex and variations in sediment supply from local rivers. The recent development of the Atchafalaya delta complex to the west is the closest position of an active distributary to the chenier plain since sealevel stabilization; a new episode of rapid mudflat progradation is thus taking place. © 1989.","Penland, S.; Suter, J.R.","","90",1989,"","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, as the concept of food security is evolving into one of nutrition security and the importance of food diversity is increasing, research based on nutrition security and broad food systems are increasingly needed in today's China. Thus, not only grain for human consumption, but also animal foods have been integrated into the Food Equivalent, which is used to analyze China's current agriculture system and reveal the water resource distribution. The results indicated that the average animal food consumption has risen by 78.6%, and now China's daily supply of animal food per capita has reached about 50% of that in the USA and 80% of that in the South Korea. So there exist an obvious disparity in animal food supply between China and these two countries. It is impossible for the China's current agricultural system to achieve the level in the USA. Under China's current agricultural system, the consumption proportion of feed grain had surpassed the consumption of food grain, increased sharply from 33% in 1992 to 67% in 2011. However, the growth potential of total grain output is approaching an upper limit, so the continued growth of feed grain demand exerts great pressure on the China's food supply. The discordance of the spatial distribution of water resource and virtual water revealed that China's current agriculture system had a low efficiency in being able to achieve food and nutrition security. China's current ""grain farming"" cannot meet the demand of increasing nutrition and appropriate resource utilization. The implementation of grassland agriculture appears feasible and necessary for saving feed grain, providing a large number of high-quality animal foods and appropriate water resource utilization. © The Author(s) 2014.","Jin, C.; Li, R.; Lin, H.; Ren, J.; Wang, C.; Wei, M.","","1",2014,"China; Food equivalent unit; Food security; Grassland agriculture; Nutrition security","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional population models built with detailed demographic observations from one study site can address the impacts of environmental change at particular locations, but are difficult to scale up to the landscape and regional scales relevant to management decisions. An alternative is to build models using population-level data that are much easier to collect over broad spatial scales than individual-level data. However, it is unknown whether models built using population-level data adequately capture the effects of density-dependence and environmental forcing that are necessary to generate skillful forecasts. Here, we test the consequences of aggregating individual responses when forecasting the population states (percent cover) and trajectories of four perennial grass species in a semi-arid grassland in Montana, USA. We parameterized two population models for each species, one based on individual-level data (survival, growth and recruitment) and one on population-level data (percent cover), and compared their forecasting accuracy and forecast horizons with and without the inclusion of climate covariates. For both models, we used Bayesian ridge regression to weight the influence of climate covariates for optimal prediction. In the absence of climate effects, we found no significant difference between the forecast accuracy of models based on individual-level data and models based on population-level data. Climate effects were weak, but increased forecast accuracy for two species. Increases in accuracy with climate covariates were similar between model types. In our case study, percent cover models generated forecasts as accurate as those from a demographic model. For the goal of forecasting, models based on aggregated individual-level data may offer a practical alternative to data-intensive demographic models. Long time series of percent cover data already exist for many plant species. Modelers should exploit these data to predict the impacts of environmental change. © 2016 The Authors.

While these models have generally been developed as separate applications, each with a separate purpose and audience, they share many common features. We present a general framework, called a state-and-transition simulation model (STSM), which captures a number of these common features, accompanied by a software product, called ST-Sim, to build and run such models. The STSM method divides a landscape into a set of discrete spatial units and simulates the discrete state of each cell forward as a discrete-time-inhomogeneous stochastic process. The method differs from a spatially interacting Markov chain in several important ways, including the ability to add discrete counters such as age and time-since-transition as state variables, to specify one-step transition rates as either probabilities or target areas, and to represent multiple types of transitions between pairs of states. We demonstrate the STSM method using a model of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change for the state of Hawai'i, USA. Processes represented in this example include expansion/contraction of agricultural lands, urbanization, wildfire, shrub encroachment into grassland and harvest of tree plantations; the model also projects shifts in moisture zones due to climate change. Key model output includes projections of the future spatial and temporal distribution of LULC classes and moisture zones across the landscape over the next 50 years. State-and-transition simulation models can be applied to a wide range of landscapes, including questions of both land-use change and vegetation dynamics. Because the method is inherently stochastic, it is well suited for characterizing uncertainty in model projections. When combined with the ST-Sim software, STSMs offer a simple yet powerful means for developing a wide range of models of landscape dynamics. Published 2016.

Relationships of normal faults, intrabasinal basalt flows, relict base levels, and provenance studies of Miocene gravel deposits all reveal the presence of rift structure development, and constrain extension to sometime between about 5 Ma and 1.8 Ma. Geomorphological relationships and a general lack of present seismicity are used to infer that rifting began and ended quite suddenly, lasting only a relatively short period.

Isotopic records are consistent with the following scenario: Before 9800 yr B.P. the two lakes were connected. Increasing evaporation through the jack/red pine period (9800-7700 yr B.P.) led to lower lake levels, leaving small separated basins. The prairie period (7700-4000 yr B.P.) reflects high aridity, and lake levels reached low stands shortly before 6500 yr B.P. Low lake levels are associated with groundwater discharge between 6500 and 6000 yr B.P. The hardwood period (4000-3200 yr B.P.) corresponds to long cold winters and warm to cool summers with lower evaporation rates and slower sedimentation. During the white pine period (<3200 yr B.P.) evaporation increased and/or precipitation shifted to the summer months. These changes can be related to shifting atmospheric circulation patterns. Zonal flow was probably dominant during the early Holocene until the end of the prairie period (c. 4000 yr B.P.). During the hardwood period a combination of zonal and meridional flow patterns caused long and cold winters and wetter summers. During the white pine period wintners were shorter and the meridional flow pattern more significant.

Hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is about 200 feet per day, and storage coefficients vary from 0.0001 to 0.30 for confined and unconfined conditions, respectively. Throughout most of the area the alluvial aquifer is overlain by the Mississippi River Valley confining unit - 10 to 50 feet of silt, clay, and fine-grained sand. It is underlain by the less permeable aquifers and confining units of the Mississippi embayment aquifer system, the McNairy-Nacatoch aquifer, and undifferentiated Paleozoic rocks. Predevelopment flow (prior to large pumpage) in the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer consisted of inflow through the overlying Mississippi River Valley confining unit, inflow from underlying aquifers, and outflow to rivers. Most inflow, about 74 percent, was through the confining unit at an average net rate of 0.8 inch per year. Individual areas differed in the relative contribution from underlying units. The simulated predevelopment potentiometric surface shows movement down the Mississippi River Valley and following the slope of land surface toward major rivers near the axes of the St. Francis, White, Arkansas, Yazoo, and Boeuf basins. Development of the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer started in the early 1900's in central Arkansas, and water use has been primarily for agriculture, particularly the irrigation of rice. Large withdrawals in other areas generally began about 1950. The largest increases in withdrawals occurred in all areas between 1973 and 1982. Maximum withdrawals before 1988 are estimated at 7,800 cubic feet per second (5,000 million gallons per day). Pumpage from the alluvial aquifer has caused a decrease in outflow to rivers, an increase fo inflow from rivers, and an increase of inflow through the overlying Mississippi River Valley confining unit. In some areas the decrease in outflow to rivers and increase in inflow have not been sufficient to meet the demands of pumpage. The long-term excess of pumpage over net inflow has resulted in regional declines in water levels, reduction of water in storage, and decreases to well yields fer some parts of the aquifer. The response of water levels in the alluvial aquifer to pumpage has followed the temporal and areal trend of development. Water levels in the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer has shown long-term drawdown of as much as 90 feet. Only parts of the aquifer north of the Arkansas River and west of Crowleys Ridge show appreciable decreases in saturated thickness. Decreases in saturated thickness through 1982 generally were 20 to 60 feet. Only the area between the Arkansas and White Rivers, where saturated thickness has decreased to less than 50 feet, may be considered to be in danger of being depleted for rice irrigation. Parts of the aquifer north of the Arkansas River and west of Crowleys Ridge, where saturated thickness has decreased to less than 75 feet throughout large areas, may be considered as not currently in danger but trending toward depletion. One percent or less of all other areas underlain by the aquifer has a decrease in saturated thickness to less than 75 feet. In some areas the direction of flow has changed compared to the predevelopment flow system. Two areas north of the Arkansas River and west of Crowleys Ridge have large depressions in the potentiometric surface and pronounced changes in the direction of flow. Pumpage has not resulted in large-scale regional changes in direction of flow in other areas underlain by the aquifer. Most of the aquifer has only a general lowering of 5 to 15 feet in the potentiometric surface. The contours of the potentiomethc head have shifted upgradient (usually north), indicating an even lowering of the potentiometric surface, resulting in only minor or local changes in direction of flow. Regional flow in the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer has steadily changed since large-scale pumpage began in the early 1900's. By the mid-1970's rivers became a source of more than 30 percent of total flow rather than the sink of net outflow as they were during predevelopment. Inflow through the Mississippi River Valley confining unit increased from a rate of 0.8 inch per year for predevelopment to 1.3 inches per year by 1982. Net inflow from underlying aquifers has varied slightly in amount but has decreased as a proportion of total flow. The alluvial aquifer has had continuous net losses of storage representing about 10 to 25 percent of pumpage. Current rates of loss of water from storage range from 1 to 8 inches per year in the Grand Prairie area, from 5 to 14 inches per year in parts of the Cache area, and are generally less than 1 inch per year elsewhere. To assess response of the regional flow system to continued development and to evaluate the potential of the aquifer to support additional development, two flow-model simulations were made to the year 2022. The effect of continued or increased development and the ability to support development were evaluated by the change in head in the aquifer and decreases in saturated thickness. Simulation results after 40 years of pumping at 1985 rates indicated a moderate effect (a decrease to less than 75 feet of saturated thickness) in the area north of the Arkansas River and west of Crowleys Ridge. Some parts of this area were unable to sustain current development (a decrease to less than 25 feet of saturated thickness). Simulation of additional pumpage over all the aquifer at the rate of 12 million gallons per day per 25-square-mile area above 1985 rates for 35 years resulted in a severe effect (less than 50 feet of remaining saturated thickness) for most of the area between the Arkansas and White Rivers and a large part of the area immediately west of Crowleys Ridge. Drawdowns from 1982 conditions were greater than 10 feet in small scattered locations throughout the rest of the area. None of these small areas coincided with decreases in saturated thickness to less than 70 feet for an area greater than 25 square miles. The areas with greatest potential for development of additional pumpage are in the central part of the delta (northwestern Mississippi), the northern part of the area east of Crowleys Ridge (south-east Missouri), and small parts of the area south of the Arkansas River. These areas coincide with thick parts of the aquifer except where drawdown in excess of 10 feet is indicated. In general, areas with more than 100 feet of saturated thickness have the greatest potential for further development of ground water. However, other areas where additional inflow can be induiced probably will be able to support additional pumpage with less saturated thickness. Sustained yields from the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer are historically greatest where inflow is induced from larger rivers and, to a limited extent, through the Mississippi River Valley confining unit. Therefore, locations where rivers are near and in good hydraulic connection with the alluvial aquifer or locations where would have the greatest potential for further development. Conversely, locations distant from areas where inflow could be induced have less potential for development even if saturated thickness is great. Predevelopment saturated thickness was more than 100 feet in the area west of Crowleys Ridge and less than 75 feet in the center of the area between the Arkansas and White Rivers. The additional saturated thickness in the area west of Crowleys Ridge is apparently only delaying an inevitable decrease in yield and reduction in use.","Ackerman, D.J.","","",1996,"","","","","","","","","",""

Coastal tallgrass prairies along the Gulf Coast of the US are currently threatened by the spread of several species of woody plants. We studied a coastal tallgrass prairie in Texas, USA, to determine if existing woody structure increased the supply of seeds from woody plants via dispersal by birds. Specifically, we determined if (i) more seedlings of an invasive tree (Tridacia sebifera) are present surrounding a native woody plant (Myrica cerifera); (ii) wooden perches increase the quantity of seeds dispersed to a grassland; and (iii) perches alter the composition of the seed rain seasonally in prairie habitats with differing amounts of native and invasive woody vegetation, both underneath and away from artificial wooden perches. More T. sebifera seedlings were found within M. cerifera patches than in graminoid-dominated areas. Although perches did not affect the total number of seeds, perches changed the composition of seed rain to be less dominated by grasses and forbs. Specifically, 20–30 times as many seeds of two invasive species of woody plants were found underneath perches independent of background vegetation, especially during months when seed rain was highest. These results suggest that existing woody structure in a grassland can promote further woody encroachment by enhancing seed dispersal by birds. This finding argues for management to reduce woody plant abundance before exotic plants set seeds and argues against the use of artificial perches as a restoration technique in grasslands threatened by woody species. © 2017 The Authors.

We estimate a 150-250 yr time lag in forestation of Alaskan tundra following climatic warming and suggest that, with rapid warming under dry conditions, there would be significant development of boreal grassland-steppe, a novel ecosystem type that was common during the late Pleistocene and today occurs south of the boreal forest in continental regions. Together, the time lag and grassland development would delay the positive feedback of vegetation change to climatic warming, providing a window of opportunity to control fossil fuel emissions, the primary cause of this warming.","Chapin III, F.S.; Starfield, A.M.","","35",1997,"","","","","","","","","",""

Ma to about 0.5 Ma. The formation records deposition of approximately 550 m of mostly fluvial sediment during a period of subsidence of the forearc. The formation was deposited by a large braided river, most likely an ancestral Klamath River, that prograded into the forearc. The only likely provenance for an anomalous conglomerate in the lower beds is fault scarps intermittently exposed near the area of deposition. The tectonic setting of this portion of the southern Cascadia forearc in late Pliocene or early Pleistocene through mid-Pleistocene was therefore one of general forearc subsidence with intermittent uplift due to faulting.

Alternatively, these plants represent populations that became established because of independent chance dispersal events. Location: This study focuses on the area east of the Rocky Mountain Continental Divide in the Province of Alberta and the State of Montana in western Canada and USA, respectively. Methods: Disjunct species were identified and their distributions mapped based on a review of occurrence maps and records, botanical floras and checklists, herbaria specimens, ecological and botanical studies, and field surveys of selected species. A disjunct species was defined as a plant population separated from its next nearest occurrence by a distance of > 300 kin. Evaluation of the hypothesis was based on a review of published and unpublished pollen stratigraphy and palaeoecological studies. The potential geographical distribution of Hypsithermal vegetation was based on modern regional-based ecosystem mapping and associated monthly temperature summaries as well as future climatic warming models. Results: The hypothesis was compatible with Holocene pollen stratigraphy, Hypsithermal permafrost and fen occurrence, and palaeosol phytolith analyses; and future global climatic warming models. Modelled regional Hypsithermal vegetation based on a 1°C increase in July temperatures relative to current conditions, indicated that much of the boreal forest zone in Alberta could have been grassland, which would explain the occurrence of Prairie species in the Peace River District. This amount of latitudinal vegetation shift (6.5°) was similar to an earlier Hypsithermal permafrost zone location study. An equivalent shift in vegetation along the eastern Cordillera would have placed south-western Montana-like vegetation and species such as Boykinia heucheriformis (Rydb.) Rosend. and Saxifraga odontoloma Piper within the northern half of the Rocky Mountains and foothills in Alberta, which represents the location of modern-day disjunct populations of these species. Main conclusions: Warmer and drier climatic conditions during the Holocene Hypsithermal resulted in the northward displacement of vegetation zones relative to their current distribution patterns. Most of Alberta was probably dominated by grasslands during this period, except the Rocky Mountains and northern highlands. Modern-day species disjunctions within the Rocky Mountains and Peace River District as well as more northerly areas such as the Yukon Territory occurred when the vegetation receded southward in response to climatic cooling after the Hypsithermal. Wind dispersal was considered an unlikely possibility to explain the occurrence of the disjunct species, as most of the plants lack morphological adaptations for long distance transport and the prevailing winds were from west to east rather than south to north. However, consumption and transport of seeds by northward migrating birds could not be excluded as a possibility.","Hills, L.V.; Strong, W.L.","","30",2003,"Climate change; Disjunct species; Holocene palaeoclimate; Palaeoecology; Palaeovegetation; Rare plants","","","","","","","","",""

During a study on the population biology of black-tailed prairie dogs in Wyoming, USA, plague was detected in a colony under intensive monitoring, providing a unique opportunity to quantify various consequences of plague. The epizootic reduced juvenile abundance by 96% and adult abundance by 95%. Of the survivors, eight of nine adults and one of eight juveniles developed antibodies to Yersinia pestis. Demographic groups appeared equally susceptible to infection, and age structure was unaffected. Survivors occupied three small coteries and exhibited improved body condition, but increased flea infestation compared to a neighboring, uninfected colony. Black-tailed prairie dogs are capable of surviving a plague epizootic and reorganizing into apparently functional coteries.

This region experienced the worst drought on record in 2011. We surveyed lesser prairie-chicken leks (i.e., communal breeding grounds) across 12 years that represented 7 years before the 2011 drought (predrought) and 4 years during and following the 2011 drought (postdrought). Grazing was annually managed with the objective of achieving ≤50% utilization of aboveground vegetation biomass. We used lek (n = 49) count data and covariates of weather and managed grazing to: (a) estimate long-term lesser prairie-chicken abundance and compare abundance predrought and postdrought; (b) examine the influence of annual and seasonal drought (modified Palmer drought index), temperature, and precipitation on long-term lesser prairie-chicken survival and recruitment; and (c) assess and compare the influence of grazing on lesser prairie-chicken population predrought and postdrought. Lesser prairie-chicken abundance was nearly seven times greater predrought than postdrought, and population declines were attributed to decreased survival and recruitment. The number of days with temperature >90th percentile had the greatest effect, particularly on recruitment. The population exhibited a substantial bust during 2011 and 2012 without a boom to recover in four postdrought years. Adaptive grazing positively influenced the population predrought, but had no effects postdrought. Results suggest that the severe drought in 2011 may have been beyond the range of environmental conditions to which lesser prairie-chickens, and likely other species, have adapted. Land management practices, such as grazing, should remain adaptive to ensure potential negative influences to all species are avoided.

Valley incision occurred during the δ 18O stage 2 sea-level lowstand, when the paleo-Calcasieu River flowed across the inner continental shelf and incised into older fluvial terraces of the Prairie Formation. The valley floor is 57 m deep beneath the modern chenier plain and rises to -30 m along the upper reaches of the modern estuary. Sea-level rise commenced about 20 ka and has continued episodically throughout the Holocene. Shoreline transgression has proceeded at varying rates in response to sea-level rise, and the incised valley is now occupied by a wave-dominated estuary, fringed by the chenier plain of western Louisiana. Lowstand deposits are poorly preserved within the Calcasieu incised valley. Deposits constituting the transgressive systems tract (TST) lie directly above the lower sequence boundary at the top of the Prairie Formation. The TST shows greatest facies diversity and clearest separation of bounding surfaces toward the present seaward end of Lake Calcasieu. Here, the TST comprises three parasequences that include fluvial, bayhead-delta, and central-basin (estuarine) deposits. Multiple flooding surfaces within the TST relate to the episodic style of sea-level rise. Highstand infilling of the valley has been characterized by near-shore marine deposition and chenier-plain progradation. Along the lower reaches of the modern Calcasieu River, the valley fill comprises transgressive central-basin and landward-stepping bayhead-delta fades, overlain by the highstand bayhead-delta complex. This study documents the most recent phase of deposition within the compound fill of a coastal-plain incised valley and demonstrates the potential importance of fluvial controls on facies within incised-valley systems.

Construction of reservoirs worldwide has disturbed riverine ecosystems by altering biotic and abiotic environments of impounded streams. Changes to fish communities in impoundments are well documented, but effects of those changes on native species persisting in reservoirs, which are presumably subjected to novel selective pressures, are largely unexplored. I assessed body shape variation of a native stream fish in reservoir habitats and streams from seven reservoir basins in the Central Plains of the USA. Body shape significantly and consistently diverged in reservoirs compared with stream habitats within reservoir basins; individuals from reservoir populations were deeper-bodied and had smaller heads compared with stream populations. Individuals from reservoir habitats also exhibited lower overall shape variation compared with stream individuals. I assessed the contribution of genotypic divergence and predator-induced phenotypic plasticity on body shape variation by rearing offspring from a reservoir and a stream population with or without a piscivorous fish. Significant population-level differences in body shape persisted in offspring, and both populations demonstrated similar predator-induced phenotypic plasticity. My results suggest that, although components of body shape are plastic, anthropogenic habitat modification may drive trait divergence in native fish populations in reservoir-altered habitats. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Franssen, N.R.","","4",2011,"Cyprinella; Fish body shape; Geometric morphometrics; Local adaptation; Phenotypic plasticity; Prairie streams; Rapid evolution; Reservoirs","","","","","","","","",""

For several decades, researchers have tried to understand how changes in biodiversity might impact biomass production by examining how biomass correlates with a number of biodiversity metrics (especially the number of species and functional groups). This body of research has focused on species with the implicit assumption that they are independent entities. However, functional and ecological similarities are shaped by patterns of common ancestry, such that distantly related species might contribute more to production than close relatives, perhaps by increasing niche breadth. Here, we analyze 2 decades of experiments performed in grassland ecosystems throughout the world and examine whether the evolutionary relationships among the species comprising a community predict how biodiversity impacts plant biomass production. We show that the amount of phylogenetic diversity within communities explained significantly more variation in plant community biomass than other measures of diversity, such as the number of species or functional groups.

However, the majority of studies relating species traits to community assembly rely upon vegetative traits of mature plants. Seed traits, which are understudied relative to whole-plant traits, are key to understanding assembly of plant communities. This is particularly true for restored communities, which are typically started de novo from seed, making seed germination a critical first step in community assembly and an early filter for plant establishment. We experimentally tested the effects of seed traits (mass, shape, and embryo to seed size ratio) and phylogeny on germination response in 32 species commonly used in prairie grassland restoration in the Midwestern USA, analyzing data using time-to-event (survival) analysis. As germination is also influenced by seed dormancy, and dormancy break treatments are commonly employed in restoration, we also tested the effects of two pretreatments (cold stratification and gibberellic acid application) on time to germination. Seed traits, phylogeny, and seed pretreatments all affected time to germination. Of all traits tested, variables related to seed shape (height and shape variance) best predicted germination response, with high-variance (i.e., pointier and narrower) seeds germinating faster. Phylogenetic position (the location of species on the phylogenetic tree relative to other tested species) was also an important predictor of germination response, that is, closely related species showed similar patterns in time to germination. This was true despite the fact that all measured seed traits showed phylogenetic signal, therefore phylogeny provided residual information that was not already captured by measured seed traits. Seed traits, phylogenetic position, and germination pretreatments were important predictors of germination response for a suite of species commonly used in grassland restoration. Shape traits were especially important, while mass, often the only seed trait used in studies of community assembly, was not a strong predictor of germination timing. These findings illustrate the ecological importance of seed traits that are rarely incorporated into functional studies of plant communities. This information can also be used to advance restoration practice by guiding restoration planning and seed mix design. © 2018 The Authors.

Soils and root systems associated with these two shrubs were studied at three sites on an alluvial fan piedmont. The soils have formed in alluvium derived from monzonite, rhyolite, and andesite, in deposits ranging in age from late Holocene to middle Pleistocene. Soil age, carbonate morphology, particle size, and landscape position were found to be major factors associated with root variability. The stage I carbonate that occurs in youngest soils has relatively little influence on root distribution because the carbonate consists only of thin coatings on sand grains and pebbles. But the increasing carbonate that occurs in stages II, III, and IV results in denser zones of carbonate that control the routes for movement of both soil water and roots. Hot only do individual nodules and cemented pebbly zones grow and eventually merge, they also represent zones of restricted hydraulic conductivity, funneling soil water and roots to as yet uncemented parts of the horizon. Continued carbonate accumulation leads to a plugged horizon and an overlying stage IV laminar horizon that is a barrier to roots. Particle size controls the time and amount of carbonate required for formation of these horizons. Calciargids of late Pleistocene age that averaged 4% and 32% by volume of gravel and contained 415 and 317 kgm-2 of pedogenic carbonate had only stage III horizons. In contrast, a Petrocalcid of the same age and averaging 63% by volume of gravel required only 205kg m2 of carbonate to form the stage IV horizon. Roots penetrated occasional openings in the stage IV horizon, Runoff from soils sloping 2% reduces the number of days with available soil water at various depths as compared to 1% slopes below. At the 2% slope, roots did not extend below 2 m depth, whereas at the 1% slope roots extended to as much as 5 m depth.","Gibbens, R.P.; Gile, L.H.; Lenz, J.M.","","39",1998,"Calciargids; Calcic horizons; Hydraulic conductivity; Petrocalcic horizons; Petrocalcids; Root depth; Root distribution; Root morphology; Stages I-IV of carbonate accumulation","","","","","","","","",""

As a unique class of translocation, population reinforcements have received relatively little attention despite representing a substantial portion of translocation programs. Here, we conducted population viability analyses to quantify the effects of 216 reinforcement scenarios on the long-term viability of four populations of Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) in Wisconsin, USA, and used multiple linear regression to identify factors that had the greatest relative influence on population viability. We considered reinforcements from outside of the study area in addition to translocations among Wisconsin populations. We observed the largest decreases in site-specific extinction probability and the largest increases in the number of sites persisting for 50 years when more vulnerable populations were targeted for reinforcement. Conversely, reinforcing the most stable sites caused the greatest reduction in regional extinction probability. We found that the number of translocated hens was a comparatively poor predictor of changes in long-term population viability, whereas the earlier onset of reinforcement was consistently associated with the greatest increases in viability. Our results highlight the value of evaluating alternative reinforcement strategies a priori and considering the effects of reinforcement on metrics of long-term population persistence. © 2018 The Authors.

Naturalised populations in the Driftless Area of the American Midwest may be beneficial for the conservation and agronomic improvement of the species. Aims: We explored the population structure and genetic diversity of Driftless Area meadow fescue populations, inferring their introduction histories to evaluate their potential contribution to conservation and breeding. Methods: We assigned plants sampled from 71 grasslands throughout the Driftless Area to genetically defined subpopulations based on neutral nuclear (nSSR) markers. Inter-population hybridisation and genetic diversity were combined with chloroplast haplotype scoring to infer introduction history. Results: We identified four subpopulations with distinct geographic distributions and haplotype composition, with 28% of sampled individuals representing admixtures of two or more subpopulations. There was moderate differentiation among subpopulations and sampling sites, with nonetheless high within-site diversity. Three chloroplast haplotypes were detected, occurring in different frequencies among subpopulations. Subpopulations appeared to have been derived from separate introductions of heterogeneous genetic material. Conclusions: Driftless Area meadow fescue populations are unlikely to contribute to conservation of locally adapted European varieties, but represent a valuable resource for the development of novel varieties and for preserving species-level genetic diversity. © 2013, © 2013 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.","Casler, M.D.; Duncan, D.S.; Jackson, R.D.; Krohn, A.L.","","8",2015,"Festuca pratensis; Paleozoic Plateau; Schedonorus pratensis; conservation genetics; genetic diversity; nSSR; range expansion","","","","","","","","",""

It is underlain by nearly horizontal, alternating thin limestones and shales of Permian age and by discontinuous Quaternary alluvium. Shallow aquifers which interact with surface-water in this region are an important steady source of water to the biota because of sporadic precipitation. This study provides a summary of the shallow hydrogeology in a typical watershed on the Konza Prairie, including an overview of directions of ground-water movement inferred from water-level data and of ground-water chemistry. Measurements made every 4 to 6 weeks for over 2.5 years provide information on spatial and temporal variability in water chemistry and in directions of ground-water flow during the end of a drought (first year), during a period of average rainfall (second year) and through a period of exceptionally high summer rainfall (third year). Well yields from the limestones (each cut by the ephemeral stream draining the watershed) are variable and depend upon secondary-porosity development. Potential for vertical flow is downward in all units and lateral flow directions are sometimes toward and sometimes away from the stream. In addition, water levels are sometimes above and sometimes below the tops of the aquifers, indicating that aquifers behave sometimes as confined and sometimes as unconfined aquifers. The stratigraphically and topographically lowest unit monitored (Morrill Limestone) is the highest yield aquifer and appears to be hydraulically linked to the stream. The uppermost unit studied (upper Eiss Limestone) has water chemistry and well yield somewhat similar to the Morrill, although there is insufficient well control to establish that it, too, is closely linked to the stream. The middle unit (lower Eiss Limestone) is characterized by lower hydraulic conductivity, steady water chemistry, and higher total dissolved solids than the upper and lower units. Despite the differing hydraulic behavior of the limestones, concentration ranges of the major elements in water samples from the aquifers overlap, with the exception of consistently higher dissolved magnesium in the lower Eiss Limestone water. Variability in hardness, alkalinity, and sulfate, the principal components of the dissolved solids, do not clearly distinguish between high-and low-permeability aquifers or parts of aquifers. Occasional, easily identified sulfate spikes are the result of dissolution of pockets of gypsum or anhydrite in the limestones. Relatively long-term, progressive depression of sulfate concentrations is probably the result of steady recharge during relatively long wet periods, and is a good indicator of flushing of the aquifers even though water levels are not elevated. Calcium and alkalinity variations at this site reflect variations in recharge as modified by seasonal variations in below-ground P-CP2. Calcium/magnesium ratios are not constant, indicating that either there is a non-carbonate mineral source for magnesium or that more than one carbonate mineral (with different magnesium contents) contributes calcium to the water. The timeseries sampling used in this study revealed information about the complicated chemical and hydraulic response of these shallow, thin limestone aquifers to variable recharge.","Macpherson, G.L.","","186",1996,"","","","","","","","","",""

The biotic record (pollen, vascular plant and bryophyle macrofossils. and insects) is preserved in floodplain alluvium that underlies three constructional surfaces separated by low scarps. Each surface is underlain by a lithologically and temporally distinct alluvial fill. The highest surface is underlain by the Gunder Member of the Deforest Formation, dating from 11 000 to 4000 yr BP; beneath the intermediate level is the Roberts Creek Member, dating from 4000 to 400 yr BP; and the lowest level is underlain by the Camp Creek Member, deposited during the last 380 yr. Pollen and plant macrofossils in the alluvial fill show that a typical late-glacial spruce forest was replaced by Quercus and Ulmus in the early Holocene. This early-to-middle Holocene forest became dominated by mesic elements such as Acer saccharum, Tilia americana, Ostrya virginiana, and Carpinus caroliniana as late as 5500 yr BP; in contrast, the closest sites to the west and north were at their warmest and driest and were covered by prairie vegetation between 6500 and 5500 yr BP. After 5500 yr BP, the forest in the Roberts Creek area was replaced by prairie, as indicated by a rich assemblage of plant macrofossils, although only Ambrosia and Poaceae became abundant in the pollen record. The return of Quercus ≈ 3000 BP (while nonarboreal pollen percentages remained relatively high) indicates that oak savanna prevailed with little change until settlement time. The bryophyte assemblages strongly support the vascular plant record. Rich fen species characteristic of boreal habitats occur only in the late-glacial. They are replaced by a number of deciduous-forest elements when early-to-middle Holocene forests were present, but mosses of forest habitats completely disappear when prairie became dominant. A few deciduousforest taxa return during the late-Holocene, when oak savanna prevailed. The C-O isotopic record from stalagmite ""s"" in Coldwater Cave indicates a relatively stable environment from ≈ 8000 to 5100 yr BP, when the 813C values indicate a change in vegetation dominated by C3 (predominantly forest) to C4 (predominantly prairie) plants. About 4900 yr BP, the rise in 18O values indicates a temperature increase of ≈ 1.5°C. The fact that the vegetational change suggested by the δ13C values preceded the temperature increase suggests that fire may have been an important factor in converting forest to prairie. Abundant charred seeds and other plant material at Roberts Creek 4830 yr BP support this hypothesis. The 18O values remain constant from ≈5100 to ≈3000 yr BP. but the δ13C values gradually rise, indicating that soil formed under forest takes at least 2000 yr for its carbon to reach equilibrium after replacement by prairie vegetation. The return of oak to form savanna is reflected in the gradual decline of δ13C values in the last 3000 yr BP: O isotopic values drop sharply by ≈ 1°C ≈ 2800 yr BP and then were relatively stable. In contrast to the vegetational and isotopic records, the insect assemblages suggest little change in the local environments throughout most of the Holocene. All of the beetle taxa presently occur in eastern Iowa. The relative stability through the Holocene indicates that both open grassland and riparian woodland elements were present throughout. Settlement, land clearing, and land cultivation by EuroAmericans in the region caused rapid erosion of the upland landscape, the deposition of 1-2 m of sediment across the floodplain, a replacement of the native vegetation with ruderal species, a decimation of the native insect fauna, and a degradation of water quality in the stream. These changes in the landscape, vegetation, and insect faunas are as striking as those associated with glacialinterglacial transitions. The timing and direction of changes in the vegetation at Roberts Creek generally correlate well with the carbon and oxygen isotopic record in speleothems at nearby Coldwater Cave and indicate that climate was the main forcing function. However, the contrast between the vegetational change and the stability of the beetle population suggests that climatic changes were subtle. We hypothesize that the factors involved in the Holocene changes were seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation that may not have resulted in much mean annual change. Such changes may have affected the vegetation more than the insect fauna.","Baker, R.G.; Bettis III, E.A.; Chumbley, C.A.; Gonzalez, L.A.; Horton, D.G.; Reagan, M.K.; Schwert, D.R.","","66",1996,"Alluvial history; Beetles; Carbon isotopes; Coleoplera; Fire: Holocene; Insects; Oxygen isotopes; Paleoclimatology; Paleoecology; Plant macrofossils; Pollen; Speleothems","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the effects of shrub expansion on the distribution, origin, turnover, and quality of light (LFC) and heavy (HFC) soil organic matter (SOM) fractions using δ13C natural abundance to partition SOM into C4 (grass) and C3 (shrub) sources. Soil organic matter beneath grasses and mesquite was isotopically distinct from associated plant litter, providing evidence of both recent shrub expansion and Holocene plant community changes. Our δ13C analyses indicated that SOM derived from mesquite was greatest beneath shrub canopies, but extended at least 3 in beyond canopy margins, similar to the distribution of line roots. Specific 14C activities of LFC indicated that root litter is an important source of SOM at depth. Comparison of turnover rates for surface LFC pools in grass (7 or 40 years) and mesquite (11 or 28 years) soils and for HFC pools by soil depth (~150-280 years), suggest that mesquite may enhance soil C storage relative to grasses. We conclude that the replacement of semiarid grasslands by woody shrubs will effect changes in root biomass, litter production, and SOM cycling that influence nutrient availability trod long-term soil C sequestration at the ecosystem level.","Chamberlain, C.P.; Connin, S.L.; Virginia, R.A.","","110",1997,"Carbon cycling; Carbon isotope; Desertification; Mean residence time; Root distribution","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, much less is known about whether different crop cultivar has an effect on the taxonomic structure and diversity, and specific functions of soil bacterial communities. Here, we examined the changes of the diversity and composition and enzyme-encoding nitrogenase genes in a long-term field experiment with seven different rhizoma peanut cultivars in southeastern USA, coupling high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the sequence-based function prediction with Tax4Fun. Of the 32 phyla detected (Proteobacteria class), 13 were dominant: Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes (relative abundance >1%). We found no evidence that the diversity and composition of bacterial communities were significantly different among different cultivars, but the abundance of some dominant bacterial groups that have N-fixation potentials (at broad or fine taxonomic level) and predicted abundances of some enzyme-encoding nitrogenase genes showed significant across-cultivar differences. The nitrogenase genes were notably abundant in Florigraze and Latitude soils while remarkably lower in Arbook and UF_TITO soils when compared with other cultivars, indicating different nitrogen fixation potentials among different cultivars.

In prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, a species widely known for forming monogamous pair-bonds, the expression of territoriality within each sex is dimorphic, and includes non-territorial ""wanderers"" as well as territorial ""residents."" To explore the variance in fitness, measured in offspring numbers, among breeding individuals expressing these alternative mating tactics, we compiled parentage data over 3 years for male and female prairie voles from natural populations in Indiana and Kansas, USA. We found that: (1) the average fitnesses of males and females within each population were identical when adjusted by the sex ratio; (2) the variance in fitness in male and female prairie voles was comparable to that of highly polygynous species; (3) The average fitnesses of male tactics, and of female tactics, were equivalent within and among years within each location; (4) consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection acting on mating phenotypes, the between-tactic variance in fitness for male and female mating tactics decreased with increasing study duration; (5) consistent with negative assortative mating, resident males, and wanderer females produced offspring primarily in monogamous partnerships, whereas wanderer males and resident females produced offspring primarily in polygamous partnerships. Our results show that the conditions necessary for the persistence of alternative mating tactics are indistinguishable from those for phenotypically less flexible alternative mating strategies, and that alternative mating tactics can evolve in both sexes in monogamous species when fitness variance within each sex is large. © 2019 Shuster, Willen, Keane and Solomon.","Keane, B.; Shuster, S.M.; Solomon, N.G.; Willen, R.M.","","7",2019,"Behavioral polymorphism; Best of a bad job; Fitness variance; Opportunity for selection; Reproductive strategies","","","","","","","","",""

The capacity to respond to selection is particularly important for species occupying managed habitats such as agricultural grasslands because of the potential for humans to accidentally influence traits. We calculated heritability and evolvability of six morphological traits in a population of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) breeding in a large agricultural landscape. We used microsatellite analysis to determine a genetic pedigree, revealing a high level of extra-pair paternity (63%) within a relatively philopatric population. For the entire population, heritabilities varied from low to high (bill width: 0.160±0.182 to tarsus length: 0.651±0.155), while evolvabilities were low across all traits (wing length: 0.035±0.013 to body mass: 0.066±0.106).

A quantitative assessment of physical processes that integrates fire-wind erosion feedbacks is therefore needed relative to vegetation change, soil biogeochemical cycling, air quality, and landscape evolution. We investigated the applicability of a novel tracer technique—the use of multiple rare earth elements (REE)—to quantify soil transport by wind and to identify sources and sinks of wind-blown sediments in both burned and unburned shrub-grass transition zone in the Chihuahuan Desert, NM, USA. Results indicate that the horizontal mass flux of wind-borne sediment increased approximately threefold following the fire. The REE tracer analysis of wind-borne sediments shows that the source of the horizontal mass flux in the unburned site was derived from bare microsites (88.5%), while in the burned site it was primarily sourced from shrub (42.3%) and bare (39.1%) microsites. Vegetated microsites which were predominantly sinks of aeolian sediments in the unburned areas became sediment sources following the fire. The burned areas showed a spatial homogenization of sediment tracers, highlighting a potential negative feedback on landscape heterogeneity induced by shrub encroachment into grasslands. Though fires are known to increase aeolian sediment transport, accompanying changes in the sources and sinks of wind-borne sediments may influence biogeochemical cycling and land degradation dynamics.

We studied valley oak (Quercus lobata), a threatened species of California (USA) savannas and oak woodlands, with a distribution forming a ring around the Central Valley grasslands. Our main goal was to determine the role of topography and land cover on patterns of gene flow and to test whether elevation or land cover forms stronger barriers to gene flow among valley oak populations. We sampled valley oaks in 12 populations across the range of this species, genotyped each tree at eight nuclear microsatellite loci, and created a series of resistance surfaces by assigning different resistance values to land cover type and elevation. We also estimated recent migration rates and evaluated them with regard to landscape features. There was a significant but weak relationship between Euclidian distance and genetic distance. There was no relationship between genetic distances and land cover, but a significant relationship between genetic distances and elevation resistance. We conclude that gene flow is restricted by high elevations in the northern part of the valley oak range and by high elevations and the Central Valley further south. Migration rate analysis indicated some gene flow occurring east–west but we suggest that the high connectivity in the northern Central Valley is facilitating the formation of these links.

Location: Cloverdale Ciénega, southwestern New Mexico. Methods: Utilizing fossil pollen and charcoal preserved in wetland sediments, a long-term record of variations in vegetation composition and fire activity was generated. The record was compared to published data on drought, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), carbon dioxide concentrations and known dates of grazing impacts to evaluate various hypotheses regarding the timing and causes of woody plant encroachment in desert grasslands. Results: The woody plant encroachment observed in the past 200 yrs is unprecedented in the context of the previous 5500 yrs of vegetation history. The observed increase in woody plant abundance was not related to droughts or changes in ENSO event frequency, and was contemporaneous with the rise in atmospheric CO2 and known grazing impacts. Charcoal influx increased in conjunction with historic woody plant pollen abundance and therefore the encroachment was not related to fire exclusion. Conclusions: The long-term sediment record from Cloverdale Ciénega provides the context for evaluation of the various hypotheses for woody plant encroachment.

Prosopis velutina (velvet mesquite) has recently expanded on over 38 million ha in the grasslands of the American southwest.Mesquite establishment and expansion is potentially influenced by competitive interactions with grasses, particle size distribution (texture) of soil and changes in the amount and/or seasonality of precipitation, amongst other factors.To investigate the relative importance of precipitation seasonality, grass competition, and soil texture on mesquite seedling and establishment, we experimentally manipulated seasonality of precipitation across 72 1.5. m. × 1.7. m plots that we planted with two grasses from contrasting functional groups (or left unvegetated) across two highly contrasting soil textures within a semi-desert grassland in Arizona, USA, wherein we followed the demography of 8640 planted mesquite seeds between 2002 and 2006. Up to 70% of the variance in seedling emergence was explained by soil water content, and seedling mortality was more dependent on summer than on winter precipitation.Mortality of less drought tolerant grasses after drought in coarse textured soils created conditions most favorable for seedling establishment, whereas lower rates of seedling establishment were observed in finer textured soils or in plots dominated by more drought tolerant grasses.We conclude that mesquite encroachment is episodic, based on discontinuous patterns of seedling establishment, favored on coarse textured soils and associated with unique conditions of high summer water availability when precipitation is not limiting and when competition from grasses is lowered. © 2012 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.","Huxman, T.E.; Resco de Dios, V.; Sun, W.; Weltzin, J.F.; Williams, D.G.","","14",2012,"Experimental water manipulation; Plant-plant interactions; Precipitation seasonality; Savannah; Soil texture; Woody plant encroachment","","","","","","","","",""

Hereditary symbionts warrant particular attention because of their direct effects on the evolutionary potential of their hosts. In plants, hereditary fungal endophytes can increase the competitive ability, drought tolerance, and herbivore resistance of their host, although it is unclear whether or how these ecological benefits may alter the dynamics of the endophyte symbiosis over time. Here, we demonstrate that herbivores alter the dynamics of a hereditary symbiont under field conditions. Also, we show that changes in symbiont frequency were accompanied by shifts in the overall structure of the plant community. Replicated 25-m2 plots were enriched with seed of the introduced grass, Lolium arundinaceum at an initial frequency of 50% infection by the systemic, seed-transmitted endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. Over 54 months, there was a significantly greater increase in endophyte-infection frequency in the presence of herbivores (30% increase) than where mammalian and insect herbivory were experimentally reduced by fencing and insecticide application (12% increase). Under ambient mammalian herbivory, the above-ground biomass of nonhost plant species was reduced compared with the mammal-exclusion treatment, and plant composition shifted toward greater relative biomass of infected, tall fescue grass. These results demonstrate that herbivores can drive plant-microbe dynamics and, in doing so, modify plant community structure directly and indirectly. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Clay, K.; Holah, J.; Rudgers, J.A.","","102",2005,"Dynamics; Endophyte; Grasslands; Herbivory","","","","","","","","",""

Of the three factors, relatively greater differences in community similarity were observed between catena positions, particularly on the ungrazed treatments. Grazing was intermediate between catena position and short-term weather in shaping plant community structure. Grazed treatments and ridgetops had a less variable species composition through fluctuations in weather. An increase with grazing of the dominant, heavily grazed species was observed. Basal cover and density of total species was also greater on grazed sites. The more uniform grazing lawn structure of the grazed plant communities had an influence on segregation of plant populations along topographical gradients. Segregation was less on grazed catenas, but diversity and the abundance of introduced and opportunistic-colonizer species was also less. Although the shortgrass steppe community was relatively invariant, less abundant species were dynamic and interactions occurred with respect to grazing, weather, and catena position. The effects of grazing may be mitigated by favorable growing seasons but magnified in unfavorable years in populations that are adapted to favorable sites. Grazing can be considered a disturbance at the level of the individual but it may or may not be a disturbance at the level of the population, and it is not a disturbance at the level of the community in this particular grassland. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Chapman, P.L.; Kazempour, M.K.; Lauenroth, W.K.; Milchunas, D.G.","","80",1989,"Catena; Community structure; Disturbance; Evolutionary history; Herbivory; Landscape","","","","","","","","",""

The life-history traits and physiology of hosts are well-known determinants of the biodiversity of their associated organisms. The environmental context may strongly influence this interaction, but the relative roles of host traits and the environment are poorly known for host-associated communities. We studied the roles of host traits and environmental characteristics affecting ant-associated mites in semi-natural constructed grasslands in agricultural landscapes of the Midwest USA. Mites are frequently found in ant nests and also riding on ants in a commensal dispersal relationship known as phoresy. During nonphoretic stages of their development, ant-associated mites rely on soil or nest resources, which may vary depending on host traits and the environmental context of the colony. We hypothesized that mite diversity is determined by availability of suitable host ant species, soil detrital resources and texture, and habitat disturbance. Results showed that that large-bodied and widely distributed ant species within grasslands support the most diverse mite assemblages. Mite richness and abundance were predicted by overall ant richness and grassland area, but host traits and environmental predictors varied among ant hosts: mites associated with Aphaenogaster rudis depended on litter depth, while Myrmica americana associates were predicted by host frequency and grassland age. Multivariate ordinations of mite community composition constructed with host ant species as predictors demonstrated host specialization at both the ant species and genus levels, while ordinations with environmental variables showed that ant richness, soil texture, and grassland age also contributed to mite community structure. Our results demonstrate that large-bodied, locally abundant, and cosmopolitan ant species are especially important regulators of phoretic mite diversity and that their role as hosts is also dependent on the context of the interaction, especially soil resources, texture, site age, and area. © 2016 The Authors.

The objectives of this study were to: (i) develop an efficient strategy for monitoring soil moisture dynamics at the hillslope scale using a wireless sensor network; and (ii) characterize spatial patterns of soil moisture and infer hydrological processes controlling the dynamics of such patterns, using a method of analysis that allows the identification of the relevant hydrological dynamics within large data sets. We combined soil hydrological and pedological expertise with geophysical measurements and methods from digital soil mapping for designing the monitoring setup for a grassland hillslope in the Schäfertal catchment, central Germany. Hypothesizing a wet and a dry soil moisture state to be characteristic of the spatial pattern of soil moisture, we described the spatial and temporal evolution of such patterns using a method of analysis based on the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. We described the persistence and switching mechanisms of the two characteristic states, inferring the local properties that control the observed spatial patterns and the hydrological processes driving the transitions. The spatial organization of soil moisture appears to be controlled by different processes in different soil horizons, and the topsoil’s moisture does not mirror processes that take place within the soil profile.

We surveyed AMF abundance and community composition in Centaurea stoebe and Potentilla recta invasions in the western USA to assess whether patterns were consistent with mycorrhizal-mediated invasions. We asked whether (1) AMF abundance and community composition differ between native and exotic forbs, (2) associations between native plants and AMF shift with invading exotic plants, and (3) AMF abundance and/or community composition differ in areas where exotic plants are highly invasive and in areas where they are not. We collected soil and roots from invaded and native forb communities along invasion gradients and in regions with different invasion densities. We used AMF root colonization as a measure of AMF abundance and characterized AMF communities in roots using 454-sequencing of the LSU-rDNA region. All plants were highly colonized (>60%), but exotic forbs tended to be more colonized than natives (P < 0.001). We identified 30 AMF operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across sites, and community composition was best predicted by abiotic factors (soil texture, pH). Two OTUs in the genera Glomus and Rhizophagus dominated in most communities, and their dominance increased with invasion density (r = 0.57, P = 0.010), while overall OTU richness decreased with invasion density (r = -0.61, P = 0.006). Samples along P. recta invasion gradients revealed small and reciprocal shifts in AMF communities with >45% fungal OTUs shared between neighboring native and P. recta plants. Overall, we observed significant, but modest, differences in AMF colonization and communities between co-occurring exotic and native forbs and among exotic forbs across regions that differ in invasion pressure.

Observed thresholds often have been low or absent, however, leaving much unexplained about habitat selection beyond initial thresholds of occurrence, even for species with strong habitat preferences. We examined responses to varying amounts of tree cover, a widely inuential measure of habitat loss, for 40 woodland bird species in a mixed woodland/grassland landscape in eastern North Dakota, USA. We used LOESS smoothing to describe incidence for each species at three scales: within 200, 400, and 1200 m around sample locations. For the 200-m scale, we also calculated the most-preferred range of tree cover (within which at least half of observations were predicted to occur) for each species. Only 10 of 40 species had occurrence thresholds greater than about 10% tree cover. After initial occurrence, species showed three general patterns: some increased monotonically with tree cover; some increased up to an asymp-tote; some peaked at intermediate amounts of tree cover and then declined. These patterns approximate selection for interior woodlands and for edge-rich environments, but incidence plots provide greater detail in landscape-scale selection than do those categories. For most species, patterns persisted at larger scales, but for some, larger scales had distinctly different patterns than local scales. Preferred ranges of tree cover varied from <20% tree cover (common grackle, Quiscalus quiscula) to >60% (veery, Catharus fuscescens). We conclude that incidence patterns provide more information on habitat selection than do threshold measures for most species: in particular, they differentiate species pre-ferring concentrated woodlands from those preferring mixed landscapes, and they show contrasting degrees of selectiveness.

We experimentally examined interactions between two microparasites (entomopathogenic nematodes) isolated from sandy grassland soils of coastal California: Heterorhabditis marelatus (Heterorhabditidae) and Steinernema feltiae (Steinernematidae). Heterorhabditis marelatus drives trophic cascades by attacking root- and stemboring ghost moth caterpillars (Hepialus californicus, Hepialidae), thereby indirectly protecting bush lupine shrubs (Lupinus arboreus, Fabaceae). Extensive field surveys demonstrated sympatric overlap in microhabitat use under lupine canopies and similar mean prevalence of the two nematode species. Using a response-surface design in the laboratory, we varied relative and absolute microparasite densities to test for competitive outcomes within an evolutionary naïve host, larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (Pyralidae), and within the native host Hepialus californicus. Independent of conspecific or interspecific density, S. feltiae dominated as expected over H. marelatus within the naïve Galleria, but S. feltiae infected hosts at low frequency and showed lower reproductive fitness than H. marelatus within native Hepialus hosts. Contrary to studies that demonstrate the pairwise dominance of steinernematid over heterorhabditid species in laboratory hosts, host resistance to S. feltiae may provide a mechanism for coexistence of multiple microparasite species. We hypothesize that the ubiquitous field prevalence and rapid life history of S. feltiae imply its use of widespread, abundant but small-bodied hosts and indicate the lack of direct competition with H. marelatus in the Hepialus-Lupinus trophic cascade. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Gruner, D.S.; Kolekar, A.; McLaughlin, J.P.; Strong, D.R.","","90",2009,"Bodega Marine Laboratory; California; Entomopathogenic nematodes; Galleria mellonella; Hepialus californicus; Heterorhabditis and Steinernema; Intraspecific and interspecific competition; Predatorprey interactions; Trophic cascade; USA","","","","","","","","",""

To validate this hypothesis, two transects of wells in a north-south and east-west orientation crossing and alongside some paleochannels in the area were instrumented with water-level-recording devices; streamflow data from all area streams were obtained from available stream-gaging stations. A theoretical approach was also developed to conceptualize numerically the stream-aquifer processes. The field data and numerical simulations provided support for the hypothesis. Thus, observation wells located along the shoulders or in between the inferred paleochannels show little or no fluctuations and no correlations with streamflow, whereas wells located along paleochannels show high water-level fluctuations and good correlation with the streamflows of the stream connected to the observation site by means of the paleochannels. The stream-aquifer numerical simulation results demonstrate that the larger the hydraulic diffusivity of the aquifer, the larger the extent of pressure pulse propagation and the faster the propagation speed. The conceptual simulation results indicate that long-distance propagation of stream floodwaves (of the order of tens of kilometers) through the Great Bend aquifer is indeed feasible with plausible stream and aquifer parameters. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the extent and speed of pulse propagation is more sensitive to variations of stream roughness (Manning's coefficient) and stream channel slope than to any aquifer parameter. © 1991.","Sophocleous, M.A.","","124",1991,"","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, other components of biodiversity, such as functional diversity, are often overlooked in assessing habitat patch value. In the Sandhills Ecoregion of Georgia, USA, we investigated the relationship between avian species richness and functional diversity, forest basal area, and patch size in pine forests using basal area as a surrogate for overstory structure which in turn impacts vegetation structure and determines habitat quality within a patch. We conducted bird surveys in planted mature pine stands, during breeding season of 2011. We used three classes of stand basal area (BA): OS, overstocked (BA ≥ 23 m2/ha); FS, fully/densely stocked (13.8 m2/ha ≤ BA &lt; 23 m2/ha); and MS, moderately stocked (2.3 m2/ha ≤ BA &lt; 13.8 m2/ha). MS patches showed more structural diversity due to higher herbaceous vegetation cover than other two pine stocking classes of patches. Total species richness and functional richness increased with the size of MS patches, whereas functional divergence decreased with the size of OS patches (p &lt; 0.05). Functional richness tended to be lower than expected as the size of OS patches increased. Greater richness of pine–grassland species was also found at MS patches. Percent cover of MS patches within a landscape influenced positively the richness of pine–grassland species (p &lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that (a) avian species–habitat area relationship can be affected by habitat quality (structural diversity) and varies depending on diversity indices considered, and (b) it is important to maintain moderate or low levels of pine basal area and to preserve large-sized patches of the level of basal area to enhance both taxonomic and functional diversity in managed pine forests. © 2018 The Authors.

Visual cover estimation is a key tool for many ecological studies, yet quadrat-based analyses are known to suffer from issues of consistency between people as well as across sites (spatially) and time (temporally). Previous efforts to estimate cover from photograps require considerable manual work. We demonstrate that an automated system can be used to estimate vegetation cover and the type of vegetation cover present using top–down photographs of 1 m by 1 m quadrats. Vegetation cover is estimated by modelling the distribution of color using a multivariate Gaussian. The type of vegetation cover is then classified, using illumination robust local binary pattern features, into two broad groups: graminoids (grasses) and forbs. This system is evaluated on two datasets from the globally distributed experiment, the Nutrient Network (NutNet). These NutNet sites were selected for analyses because repeat photographs were taken over time and these sites are representative of very different grassland ecosystems—a low stature subalpine grassland in an alpine region of Australia and a higher stature and more productive lowland grassland in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. We find that estimates of treatment effects on grass and forb cover did not differ between field and automated estimates for eight of nine experimental treatments. Conclusions about total vegetation cover did not correspond quite as strongly, particularly at the more productive site. A limitation with this automated system is that the total vegetation cover is given as a percentage of pixels considered to contain vegetation, but ecologists can distinguish species with overlapping coverage and thus can estimate total coverage to exceed 100%. Automated approaches such as this offer techniques for estimating vegetation cover that are repeatable, cheaper to use, and likely more reliable for quantifying changes in vegetation over the long-term. These approaches would also enable ecologists to increase the spatial and temporal depth of their coverage estimates with methods that allow for vegetation sampling over large spatial scales quickly. © 2018 The Authors.

If herbivore and host co-evolve following their first interactions, we would expect increases over evolutionary time in plant tolerance to attack, and usually decreases over time in insect virulence (because most insect herbivores depend for resources on continued survival of their hosts). The result should be a pattern of decreased herbivore impact through time. This is the 'evolution-of-impact hypothesis'. Organism: Two specialist gallmakers of the goldenrods Solidago altissima L. and S. gigantea Ait.: Rhopalomyia solidaginis/capitata (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), and Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae). Site of experiments: Tallgrass prairie at two sites in Iowa, USA. Predictions: For both gallmakers, S. gigantea is the novel host and S. altissima the older one. We therefore predict a higher impact of both gallmakers on S. gigantea than S. altissima. However, we predict a similar impact on each species of mechanical damage, with which both hosts have long evolutionary experience. Methods: We measured the aboveground biomass of galled and ungalled ramets from the field to assess herbivore impact by each gallmaker on each species. We used stem width-biomass relationships for ungalled ramets, applied to stem widths of galled ramets, to estimate the potential biomass of galled ramets in the absence of attack. We calculated impact as potential minus actual biomass. We also re-analysed similar data for a third gallmaker of the same hosts, Gnorimoschema gallaesolidaginis (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) from Heard and Kitts (2012). We assessed impacts of mechanical damage with field and greenhouse experiments of clipping and defoliation damage imposed on ramets of each species. Results: All three gallmakers had a higher impact on the novel host (S. gigantea) and, combined across all datasets, the pattern of higher impact on the novel host was highly significant. Impacts of mechanical damage did not differ between host species.

For birds, nest site selection is crucial to offspring production because nests are exposed to extreme weather and predation pressure. Predators that forage using olfaction often dominate nest predator communities; therefore, factors that influence olfactory detection (e.g., airflow and weather variables, including turbulence and moisture) should influence nest site selection and survival. However, few studies have assessed the importance of olfactory cover for habitat selection and survival. We assessed whether ground-nesting birds select nest sites based on visual and/or olfactory cover. Additionally, we assessed the importance of visual cover and airflow and weather variables associated with olfactory cover in influencing nest survival. In managed grasslands in Oklahoma, USA, we monitored nests of Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) during 2015 and 2016. To assess nest site selection, we compared cover variables between nests and random points. To assess factors influencing nest survival, we used visual cover and olfactory-related measurements (i.e., airflow and weather variables) to model daily nest survival. For nest site selection, nest sites had greater overhead visual cover than random points, but no other significant differences were found. Weather variables hypothesized to influence olfactory detection, specifically precipitation and relative humidity, were the best predictors of and were positively related to daily nest survival. Selection for overhead cover likely contributed to mitigation of thermal extremes and possibly reduced detectability of nests. For daily nest survival, we hypothesize that major nest predators focused on prey other than the monitored species’ nests during high moisture conditions, thus increasing nest survival on these days. Our study highlights how mechanistic approaches to studying cover informs which dimensions are perceived and selected by animals and which dimensions confer fitness-related benefits. © 2017 The Authors.

These transformations exert a fundamental control on lithology and reservoir properties, yet their stratigraphic record has been poorly evaluated in ancient examples due to the lack of extensive three-dimensional exposures. Here, a unique exhumed meander plain exposed to the north of Scarborough (Yorkshire, UK) is analysed in terms of architecture and morphodynamics, with the aim of developing a comprehensive model of facies distribution. The studied outcrop comprises tidal platforms and adjacent cliffs, where the depositional architecture of un-tilted deposits was assessed on planform and vertical sections, respectively. In its broader perspective, this study demonstrates the potential of architectural mapping of extensive planform exposures for the reconstruction of ancient fluvial morphodynamics. The studied exhumed meander plain is part of the Scalby Formation of the Ravenscar Group, and originally drained small coastal incised valleys within the Jurassic Cleveland Basin. The meander plain is subdivided into two storeys that contain in-channel and overbank architectural elements. In-channel elements comprise expansional and downstream-migrating point bars, point-bar tails and channel fills. Overbank elements comprise crevasse complexes, levées, floodplain fines and lake fills. The evolution of the point bars played a significant role in dictating preserved facies distributions, with high flood-stage nucleation and accretion of meander scrolls later reworked during waning flood-stages. At a larger scale, meander belt morphodynamics were also a function of valley confinement and contrasts in substrate erodibility. Progressive valley infilling decreased the valley confinement, promoting the upward transition from prevalently downstream migrating to expansional meander belts, a transition associated with enhanced preservation of overbank elements. Strikingly similar relations between valley confinement, meander-bend transformations and overbank preservation are observed in small modern meandering streams such as the Beaver River of the Canadian prairies and the Powder River of Montana (USA). © 2014 International Association of Sedimentologists.","Ghinassi, M.; Ielpi, A.","","61",2014,"Counter-point bar; Downstream migration; Fluvial; Meander; Point bar; Scroll","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that the sources of organic matter changed in response to regional hydrologic shifts following de-glaciation, and to human population expansion in the state during the 20th century. Hydroclimate shifts in Florida were related to: 1) a steady rise in relative sea level and the fresh water table that began in the early Holocene, 2) wetland formation and expansion ca. 5,000 cal yrs BP, and 3) the onset of the modern El Niño (ENSO) cycle ~3,000 cal yrs BP. Stratigraphic changes in sediment variables from Lake Harris reflect each of these hydroclimate periods. Early in the Holocene, Lake Harris was a marsh-like system in a relatively dry, open-prairie environment. Organic sediments deposited at that time were derived largely from terrestrial sources, as inferred from high TOC/TN ratios, a dominance of longer-chain of n-alkanes (n-C29-31), relatively negative organic carbon isotope values (δ13CTOC), and low biogenic silica concentrations. In the middle Holocene, a positive shift in δ13CTOC coincided with the onset of wetter conditions in Florida. Submerged macrophyte biomarkers (n-C21-23) dominated, and during that period bulk organic carbon isotope values were most similar to δ13C values of mid-chain-length n-alkanes. In the late Holocene, δ13CTOC values declined, CaCO3 levels decreased to trace amounts, organic carbon concentrations increased and diatom biogenic silica concentrations increased from 10 to 120 mg g-1. Around 2,900 cal yrs BP, the effects of ENSO intensified and many Florida lakes deepened to their current limnetic state. Concentrations of algal and cyanobacterial biomarkers in the Lake Harris core increased by orders of magnitude after about AD 1940, in response to human-induced eutrophication, an inference supported by values of δ15N that fluctuate around zero. © 2018 Arnold et al.

We conducted 15 releases into large circular arenas in 4 natural nesting areas and 2 atypical areas. Hatchling orientation and dispersal for both species were 1) all nonrandom, 2) appeared to be based on vision (i.e., nonpolarized light), and 3) toward nearby, open, and highly illuminated horizons, regardless of whether or not they were associated with the wetlands. A first-order estimate of hatchling snapping turtle perception distance was 55-90 m. We found no evidence that suggests that specular light from the wetlands, olfaction, or humidity gradients were important in orientation. At 2 of 3 locations, substantial changes in orientation direction occurred when hatchling snapping turtles were released in morning vs. late afternoon. Changes in dispersal directions in the morning and afternoon indicated that hatchlings were not orienting toward the sun per se but toward different highly illuminated nearby prairie areas. At one site, hatchling orientation in the afternoon (but not in the morning) was toward a nearby wetland and was consistent with either dispersal toward highly illuminated near horizon or with the perception and use of reflected polarized light from the wetland. Collectively, the results from our study also indicate that 1) hatchlings disperse toward open horizons rather than toward wetlands themselves (i.e., open areas that are not necessarily associated with wetlands), 2) dispersal direction is influenced by time of day, apparently because of changes in the degree of illumination of different horizons, and 3) far horizons apparently were not used because they were beyond the perception distance of hatchlings. The most parsimonious evolutionary explanation of solutions to orientation problems is that, for each species, both adults and hatchlings have similar perception distances and use the same sensory modes and types of environmental cues during terrestrial movements. Comprehensive conservation and management plans for aquatic turtles should include consideration of how habitat changes in nesting areas might alter the environmental cues that determine the initial orientation and successful dispersal of hatchlings. We compared the results from this study with the dispersal patterns of naïve hatchling Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) that emerge from nests located much farther from wetlands. © 2011 Chelonian Research Foundation.","Brecke, B.; Capps, J.; Congdon, J.D.; Pappas, M.","","10",2011,"Chelydra serpentina; Chrysemys picta belli; Emydidae; Minnesota, USA; Reptilia; Testudines, Chelydridae; dispersal from nests; naïve hatchlings; orientation; turtle","","","","","","","","",""

However, phylogenetic approaches have rarely been applied to monitoring long-term community change or guiding management. We analysed a 25-year resampling data set (1976-2001) of 41 tallgrass prairie remnants (Illinois, USA) to test for phylogenetic signals of plant community structure, change, environmental associations, fire management and functional traits. A community phylogeny was constructed using GenBank sequences, and trait data were acquired from the TRY consortium. Phylogenetic measures of alpha and beta diversity were compared with taxonomic and functional measures. From 1976 to 2001, communities became more phylogenetically clustered relative to null model expectations, that is increasingly restricted to subsets of species more closely related than expected by chance. Phylogeny was a sensitive indicator of environmental gradients and fire management. There were strong relationships between phylogeny and traits: key traits were phylogenetically non-random and phylogenetic diversity was a necessary complement to species richness for explaining variation in trait diversity. Phylogeny revealed a shift in community structure over time, with sites having been phylogenetically random in 1976 but becoming differentiated from each other by 2001. In contrast, measures of taxonomic and functional diversity showed differentiation at both time points. Phylogenetic patterns likely reflected changes in species' abundances mediated by the influence of environmental conditions and fire frequency. Synthesis and applications. Phylogenetic analyses can elucidate factors central to sound monitoring and management of plant communities. In this system, phylogeny was not a proxy for other indicators, but provided information complementing taxonomic-based and trait-based approaches for understanding vegetation structure, change and response to fire management. Phylogenetic approaches to ecological analysis are increasingly accessible, but fuller understanding of phylogeny-trait relationships and further development of user-friendly analytical tools are needed for phylogenetics to widely inform restoration and management. In some systems, targeting phylogenetic diversity may be an effective means for restoring functionally diverse plant communities.

The term ""Waulsortian mound"" is used for a variety of Early Mississippian carbonate buildups that share a number of features including an abundance of carbonate mud, a ""framework"" of organisms such as fenestrate bryozoans and crinoids that tended to trap or baffle sediment, and a general absence of marine-cemented reef framework. Although the age of the Lodgepole mound at Dickinson Field qualifies it to be a Waulsortian mound, petrographic study of cores reveals that the reservoir rocks are quite unlike those in true Waulsortian mounds. Instead of being dominated by carbonate mud, the Lodgepole mound core is dominated by marine cement. Furthermore, ostracods and microbial limestones are common in the mound core where they occur with crinoid debris and small amounts of bryozoan, coral, and brachiopod debris. The abundant microbial limestones and marine cement indicate that the Dickinson mound formed as a lithified reef on the sea floor rather than as a Waulsortian mud mound. The microbial limestones, marine cement, and common ostracods in the mound core, and the fact that the mound nucleated almost directly on top of the Bakken Shale, suggest that the Dickinson Lodgepole mound formed at the site of a submarine spring and gas seep. Compaction waters expelled from the underlying Bakken, along with carbon dioxide and methane derived from the abundant organic matter in that interval, created a ""vent community."" This community consisted of organisms such as bacteria and opportunistic ostracod genera that thrived in hundreds of feet of water while rapid precipitation of fibrous marine calcite cement occurred on the sea floor. During times when fluid and gas expulsion at the vent or seep slowed or ceased, the marine-cemented mound provided an ideal substrate for colonization by normal marine organisms such as crinoids and, to a lesser extent, fenestrate bryozoans and corals. During times of rapid seepage, the water chemistry atop the complex of springs and gas vents limited the growth of normal marine organisms. Even during these times, however, normal marine animals such as crinoids and bryozoans did thrive on the flanks of the buildup. This model may have significant exploration implications because it would mean that the distribution of such mounds was not controlled solely by water depth, paleotopographic relief, position at the toe of a clinoform slope, or sites of Prairie Evaporite solution. Instead, intersecting sets of regional fractures through sites of thick, organic-rich Bakken shales could have provided places for the gas seeps and vent communities to develop. While the carbonate buildups formed at such vents would typically be small in areal extent (<1 mi2), they could coalesce into composite complexes, attain thicknesses of up to 300 ft, and, as the Dickinson Field mound shows, be capable of containing millions of barrels of oil.","Longman, M.W.","","33",1996,"","","","","","","","","",""
